1,Teacher, 
4,Single student,A lot.
5,New student,Yes?
8,Single student,I really don't understand it.
10,New student,"Teacher, aren't we allowed to (inaudible)?"
11,Teacher,Yes.
16,Teacher,"Yes, yes, yes, yes."
17,New student,I said just leave it.
22,Teacher,"Okay, ladies and gentlemen. Ravi, your punishment lines?"
24,New student,"Oh, yes."
26,Teacher,"As first thing, before I forget again."
27,New student,(inaudible) that too?
29,Teacher,I have already shown that one. He already had that neatly signed off. The rest of you also grab your things.
37,Teacher,"Where are you coming- oh, you already went. Okay."
46,New student,Wasn't that twice then?
47,New student,Once.
48,New student,"Twice we were supposed to, didn't we? Oh."
57,Teacher,Yup! Very good. Very good.
65,Teacher,"Okay. Um, like I said yesterday, today we will begin with Pythagoras. Which one of you ever heard of Pyth- Pythagoras?"
78,New student,Uh...
79,Teacher,Uncle Pete.
80,New student,"Pete, Pete, Pete."
81,Teacher,"Tell us, what do you know about it?"
83,New student,It's a gentleman.
84,New student,"A squared plus B squared, equals C squared."
85,Teacher,You know the equation A squared plus B squared equals C squared. Who else can say more about it?
89,New student,"Uh, I think this guy was a Greek."
92,Teacher,"The, uh, this gentleman was Greek."
93,New student,Yup.
94,Teacher,"Or at least during that time period, somewhere in that region."
97,Teacher,Okay. Does anyone know when you would use the Pythagoras' theorem and what you would use it for?
103,New student,"Yes, in a diagram."
104,Teacher,In a diagram. You obviously have a diagram. I am crazy about diagrams.
108,New student,(inaudible)
109,Teacher,"Something about triangles, indeed. Well, let's take another look."
115,Teacher,What well-known triangles do we know? We have different types of triangles.
119,New student,Right-angled.
120,Teacher,We have a right-angled triangle.
121,New student,Isosceles.
127,Teacher,What is a characteristic of a right-angled triangle?
130,New student,"It has, it has one-"
133,Teacher,Ruben?
134,New student,It has a right angle.
135,Teacher,"In any case, it has a right angle."
140,Teacher,You can see that by the little symbol. What other kinds of triangles do we have?
144,New student,An isosceles triangle.
145,Teacher,An isosceles triangle.
151,Teacher,What is characteristic of an isosceles triangle?
154,Single student,Two equal sides.
155,Teacher,"Two equal sides. Like this, for instance. I will just name the sides that are equal, for example A, the other one B. Meaning:"
167,Teacher,"if I fill in a number for A, then I have to use the same number for every A I come across."
172,Teacher,What else do I know about an isosceles triangle?
177,Teacher,"If I look at angles, for example? Maarten."
178,New student,That A and B are equal.
180,Teacher,A and B are equal in size. Very good. And I have another special triangle. Which one?
187,New student,Equally shaped.
188,Teacher,An equilateral triangle.
189,Single student,Oh.
195,Teacher,What is characteristic of an equilateral triangle? Julie.
198,New student,All sides are equal.
199,Teacher,"All the sides are equal, all three sides."
209,Teacher,So one could say: all the sides are A. Would there be anything else I can mention about an equilateral triangle?
215,New student,"Um, all angles are equal."
218,Teacher,All angles are equal. And can we tell how wide they are?
221,Single student,"Yes, 180 divided by three."
222,Teacher,One hundred eighty divided by three and that is?
225,Single student,Sixty.
226,Teacher,Sixty.
231,Teacher,"Okay. So as we noticed before, we use Pythagoras in a triangle. But I have three types of triangles."
239,Teacher,And we only use Pythagoras in a right-angled triangle. So we are going to continue with a right-angled triangle.
246,Teacher,And the other triangles you will come across at some point later in the chapter.
249,Teacher,Because you will be making right-angled triangles from these- or in these. Which enables you to cal- calculate things.
259,Teacher,Another thing we noticed yesterday-
263,Teacher,"No, let me first pick up something else. I'll go- I'll return to the right-angled triangle."
270,Teacher,Except I placed it on its side.
273,Teacher,"We know that the edges of a triangle- or any figure- are called ""sides""."
278,Teacher,"In a right-angled triangle, this side is attached to a right angle. So what should we call this side? A right-angled side."
287,Teacher,Yes? Because this side is attached to a right angle so you call that a right-angled side.
300,Teacher,Do we have any other right-angled side in there?
302,New student,Yes.
303,Teacher,"Yes, all the way on the other side. That one is attached to the right angle as well, therefore you call that a right-angled side as well."
319,Teacher,"Then I still have one side left. It isn't so obvious because it is laying flat. But if you see this triangle, what can we call that side?"
328,New student,The long side.
329,Teacher,The long side. That is correct. Or in a different way?
333,New student,The right side?
334,Teacher,"It is actually at an angle. If you see it in such an- like a diagonal- so you call this the sloped side or the hypotenuse, is what you call this one."
345,Teacher,"These are just names, you know, you may also keep calling this ""the long side"", no problem."
350,Teacher,"Okay, with Pythagoras, soon, once we have gotten to know Pythagoras, we will use Pythagoras to calculate the sides."
358,Teacher,"Because all we know now about a triangle and the size of its side, is when we measure it."
363,Teacher,"However, those triangular protractors, how exact are they really?"
367,Teacher,"We know from, uh, the drawing of your number line, from, for example, of the square root of five-"
374,Teacher,"Well, you can't really measure that exactly."
376,Teacher,Because the square root of five had such an odd number behind the point. And still we can calculate things in the end with Pythagoras.
386,Teacher,"Yesterday we saw, when I have a square, with a surface of, say, 37,"
395,Teacher,"we could calculate, or at least determine how large the side was of such a square."
400,Teacher,"And we were actually able to do that quite precisely. Namely, Maarten?"
404,New student,The square root of 37.
405,Teacher,"The square root of 37. Okay, so that's ""when I know the surface area of a square, how do I determine the sides again?"" Okay, very well."
419,Teacher,That is already kind of what's explained in assignment one.
423,Teacher,This has to do with assignment two. That diagram is shown at assignment two.
432,Teacher,We have here- I am just going to skip several parts of exercise two because we will not do all that.
438,Teacher,We have a large square here: O E F G. As well as a square that is tilted at a corner: square A B C D.
449,Teacher,"I would like to know what the size the lengths are of the square A B C D,"
454,Teacher,for example what's the length of A B. We can't measure it and yet we are able to calculate it right now.
461,Teacher,"Because we have seen that once I knew the surface area of a square, I was able to determine the sides."
466,Teacher,So I would like to calculate what the surface area is of the square A B C D. How can we do that? By which method? Rene?
475,New student,"Well, I think you have to up on top of the large square- oh, no, that's something you don't know-"
481,Teacher,"Yes, though."
482,Single student,"Yes, then you have to, uh, remove those angles- or, uh, yes, well, that's how you get the small square."
487,Teacher,Very good. You have to calculate the surface area of the large square: O E F G.
492,Teacher,"And then you take the surface areas of the triangles, you subtract that. Very well."
497,Teacher,"What is the surface area of the large square, of the O E F G?"
508,Teacher,How much?
510,New student,"Uh, nine centimeters squared."
511,Teacher,"Nine- well, what the unit is I don't know, I didn't specify that. But if it were shown in centimeters, then you're right."
517,Teacher,Right now I don't have a unit. Therefore the total surface area is indeed nine.
520,Teacher,"Namely three by three, or you can just count the squares- that gives us nine."
525,Teacher,So we're told that we have to remove the surface areas of the triangles. What is the surface area of one of those triangles?
530,Teacher,How do we calculate that again?
534,Teacher,Willem?
535,New student,I don't know how you calculate it but I can just see it.
537,Teacher,You can just see it. What is the outcome according to you if you are just able to see it?
541,Single student,"Um, four in total comes off because one of those, uh..."
546,Teacher,One of these triangles?
547,Single student,That is one.
548,Teacher,That is one. Okay.
549,Single student,And there are four of those.
550,Teacher,"Correct, but how are you able to calculate that again? Leni?"
554,New student,You make it into a rectangle?
556,Teacher,I- I am just going to pull it aside. So these are then the three surface areas of the triangle that we want to calculate.
564,Teacher,We will make it into a rectangle. And then?
569,Single student,We calculate the surface area.
571,Teacher,"We calculate the surface area. That was one by two, so the whole surface area together of the rectangle is then two."
577,Teacher,"And I just need to take half of that, which brings us to one, very good."
586,Teacher,So the surface areas of the triangles-
594,Teacher,So the surface areas of the triangles together here is four. So what is left is five.
605,Teacher,"So the surface of the square in the center, A B C D, is five."
612,Teacher,"And now we can finally, after all that calculating, determine one of those sides. Namely, that is?"
618,New student,The square root of five.
619,Teacher,The square root of five. Very good.
624,Teacher,So we've got no problem figuring this out. We may not even need Pythagoras at all.
628,New student,No.
629,Teacher,But it is kind of a hassle if you constantly have to draw on like this.
632,Teacher,"Because, suppose you wanted to know the length of this little line."
638,Teacher,"If you want to calculate that you first have to, you first have to draw a square again, like this one and another square around it."
644,Teacher,And then calculating it again. So it's a real hassle. So we're going to do that differently.
650,Teacher,The example given in the book is that assignment four and five. I will just do that one with the overhead projector.
674,Teacher,"Okay, we see, we see at assignment four, they have given two plates. Well, I drew those too, I have two plates."
684,Teacher,They should be equal in size.
686,Teacher,"Well, if I place them on top of one another, they are indeed- if I place them very neatly on top of each other, equal in size."
693,New student,Yes. Yes.
695,Teacher,Well...
696,New student,Approximately.
697,Teacher,They are really equal in size but they stick a bit.
700,New student,Yes.
701,Teacher,There. Yes? Convinced?
703,Two or more students,Yes.
704,Teacher,"Very good. Yes, of course there are some who will never be convinced."
708,New student,I said yes.
709,Teacher,"Yes, but I also heard a no."
716,Teacher,Then we also see- here they made eight right-angled triangles.
719,Teacher,"Namely, four right-angled triangles in the one board and four right-angled triangles in the other board."
725,Teacher,I cut those as well. Those are also equal in size. When I stack them on top of each other they're all equal in size.
730,Teacher,So it's truly a stack of eight and I will take them off from there.
734,Teacher,We will lay it down just like it is shown in the diagram in the book.
737,New student,Which question?
738,Teacher,Question four is what we are working on.
752,Teacher,"Very well, we are now able to, in the same way as exercise- what? Is one lying incorrectly?"
757,Two or more students,No.
758,Teacher,"Oh? Yes, it's crooked- I mean it is loose."
762,Two or more students,(inaudible)
765,Teacher,"Now, should we know the size of everything, we could calculate what the area is of the square in the middle here."
771,Teacher,"Namely, in the same way that we did over there."
774,Teacher,The surface of the whole board and then the surface area of those three- of those four triangles taken off. We won't do that.
781,Teacher,"Now I will, with the other four triangles I have, I will make the other one."
791,Teacher,"It lies in this corner over here, and it lies in that corner over there."
802,Teacher,"Those triangles- those four triangles that are lying over here, are equal in size as the triangles that are lying over there."
807,New student,Yes.
808,Teacher,I knew that the board is equal in size. What am I able to say about the surface of this square and that square?
814,New student,They are equally big as the other ones.
816,Teacher,Together they are- if I add these two surface areas together- are equal in size as that one. Yes?
821,Teacher,Because the boards are equal in size. And the triangles are equal in size. Okay...
827,Teacher,"What they indicate in the book, then, is that they are going to put those boards on top of each other. Yes?"
832,Teacher,"Well, you can't see through the board but you can through the overhead sheets."
835,Teacher,So I will just remove that then because in the book it is shown underneath it. And I will try to place it on top of it.
843,Teacher,Approximately. I may not move anything. There.
848,Teacher,We are still aware that the surface area of this square is equal in size as the surface of this square plus that square together.
855,Teacher,Because they are still the same boards and they are still the same triangle.
861,Teacher,"What are we going to say now? What are we going to look at? Imagine that this side- that that is 12,"
863,Teacher,then what is the surface area of the square that is attached to it?
870,New student,Twelve times 12.
871,Teacher,Twelve times 12. And that is?
872,Single student,One hundred forty-four.
873,Teacher,One hundred forty-four.
874,New student,Without a calculator.
875,New student,Oh yes.
877,Teacher,"The short side, that is five."
880,New student,Twenty-five.
881,Teacher,"So it becomes 25 indeed. What do I know about the large square, then?"
887,New student,One hundred forty-four plus 25.
888,Teacher,That 144 plus 25 and that is?
893,New student,(inaudible)
894,Teacher,One hundred sixty-nine.
897,Teacher,"If I know that the surface area of the large square is 169, can I say something about how long this sloped side is?"
904,New student,Which angle?
905,Teacher,Of this- of this side of the square. It is also the side of the triangle. Namely?
910,New student,Half of 12.
911,New student,Twelve.
912,Two or more students,The square root of 169.
913,Teacher,The square root of 169. Why should you take half of 12?
920,Teacher,"On this side, I have this triangle lying over here. The one side is 12, the other side is five. I want to know the hypotenuse."
927,Teacher,I knew that the surface areas of the squares that are lying here- that have exactly the same sides as the sides of the triangle-
935,Teacher,if it'd be so kind as to stay on it's spot-
939,Teacher,is equal in size as the surface area of the large square. Yes?
942,Teacher,We have seen that the surface area of the large square is 169.
946,Teacher,"Now I would like to know one side, that is the side of the square, which is at the same time also the side of this, of this triangle,"
954,Teacher,"which is indeed the square root of 169, which is 13."
961,Teacher,Yes? And that is actually sort of- of what Pythagoras was talking about.
966,Teacher,"Pythagoras says that if I place a square on the one right-angled side,"
971,Teacher,so the surface area of the square I will calculate. I will place another square on the other- the shorter side.
979,Teacher,"I will take the surface area of that too, of that square. If I add these two surface areas together,"
984,Teacher,apparently- he discovered all this- they are exactly the same as the surface area...
992,Teacher,of the square that is placed on the hypotenuse. Yes?
996,Teacher,I'll show that one to you in a second. As I will write the general rule on the board.
1046,Teacher,"We have seen- ladies and gentlemen, we are going to continue. Ravi. Rick!"
1056,Teacher,Okay. This is the same as what was just on the screen. Suppose that this is the triangle of which this side is 12.
1066,Teacher,Then we would know that the surface area of this square was 144.
1070,Teacher,"If this surface area is five, then this one is 25."
1075,Teacher,"This one was 144 plus 25, is then 169."
1080,New student,So the length is 13.
1082,Teacher,So this one is 13. That was also what we just had on the screen. But now we are going to construct very generally-
1086,New student,Now I get it!
1090,Teacher,"It is also actually in the book, except I am writing it down a bit more detailed."
1093,Teacher,So perhaps it would be smart if you copied it. Then you can always retrieve it.
1114,New student,Yak!
1117,Teacher,Ladies!
1123,Teacher,The Pythagorean theorem. What have we done? We had a right-angled triangle. It only applies to right-angled triangles.
1132,Teacher,"One of those right-angled sides, let's take 12 as the first right-angled side. What did we do with this right-angled side?"
1137,Teacher,We took the square of this right-angled side. In fact we glued a square over it and calculated its surface.
1144,Teacher,"So you took one right-angled side, squared. So we will write that down: one right-angled side, squared."
1151,New student,Are you supposed to-
1153,Teacher,Yup.
1154,Single student,"You are supposed to copy that thing, right?"
1156,Teacher,What I am writing down you have to copy.
1158,Single student,Oh. Ah.
1166,Teacher,"So we had: one right-angled side squared, that is, in other words, the surface area of the square. What did we do with that?"
1177,Teacher,We added the surface area of the square that was on the other right-angled side to it.
1181,Teacher,How did we determine the surface area of the other square again?
1184,Teacher,So that is plus- taking the other right-angled side squared.
1208,Teacher,"So we had the one right-angled side squared, which is in fact the surface area of the square that you attached to it."
1213,Teacher,Plus the other right-angled side squared: the surface area of the other square that you attached to it.
1219,Teacher,What is it equal to? To the surface area of the large square that is on the hypotenuse.
1224,Teacher,"So actually, surface area is the same as that side squared."
1231,Teacher,This is: the hypotenuse.
1250,Teacher,So that is the hypotenuse squared. Does that thing bother you? Sorry. Since I won't be needing this one anymore.
1265,Teacher,There.
1270,New student,The table is slanted.
1274,Teacher,So this is the general theorem. Let's see if it will work if we apply it.
1292,Teacher,Gentlemen! Come on.
1299,Teacher,By now you guys must know that I am crazy about diagrams and tables and things like that.
1304,New student,"Yes, we knew that because you already told us yesterday."
1306,Teacher,There we go. There we go. Good thing the book utilizes that too. Otherwise I would have to explain it all by myself once again.
1312,Teacher,"But the book utilizes it too. So we are going to- to calculate those sides, we will also use the diagram."
1319,Teacher,"Well, if you copy this, Ravi, it'll speed up your homework for you will have done this assignment already."
1323,Two or more students,(inaudible) fast hey (inaudible).
1344,Teacher,Okay. Here I have a right-angled triangle of which I already know two of the right-angled sides. The hypotenuse I don't know yet.
1352,Teacher,"That's what I want to calculate. We will make a small table. I named it ""side"" on one side."
1359,Teacher,As in: how long is the side going to be that I am about to fill in- Rick?
1361,Teacher,You know you can also proceed in the hallway if you're so sure you understand it.
1368,Teacher,And the squared value actually represents the surface area of the square that you placed on the sides.
1375,New student,Yes.
1376,New student,What?
1377,Teacher,"So here I have- what were we supposed to do? The one right-angled side. ""The right-angled side"" I will abbreviate."
1383,Teacher,Because otherwise you will keep writing. I need the one right-angled side; I need the other right-angled side.
1395,New student,Yes?
1396,Teacher,"Ladies, would you please just be a little more quiet as well?"
1399,New student,They are filming in this chicken coop.
1402,Teacher,That doesn't matter. I just want it quiet for myself.
1406,Teacher,And we have a hypotenuse. Yes?
1411,Teacher,So what did we see? We were going to take the one side and square it because that was in fact the one with the square attached to it.
1416,Teacher,"And you were going to determine the surface area of that. That one side is in this case, for example, three."
1421,Teacher,"What is- is that squared? Or in other words, what is the surface area of the square that you attach to it, Julie?"
1424,New student,Nine.
1425,Teacher,That is nine.
1426,Two or more students,Julie?
1427,Teacher,Julie? Am I-
1429,Two or more students,She is sick!
1430,Teacher,"Oh, she is sick, yes, well then people shouldn't move around like that. Sorry, Myrte."
1434,Teacher,"The other right-angled side is four, so that is squared."
1441,Teacher,Now you should listen very carefully because this is a mistake that is often made.
1445,Teacher,"We had said, the one right-angled side squared plus the other right-angled side squared. Those are the only ones you may add together."
1450,Teacher,So only the squared sides. So not your regular sides.
1456,Teacher,So you are allowed to only add this side. And that gives you?
1462,New student,Twenty-five.
1464,New student,"Oh, that is four times four and three times three and then subtract-"
1466,New student,Then the other one is five.
1468,Teacher,And then I would indeed want to know: how long is the hypotenuse.
1472,Teacher,You know that the 25 represents the surface area of this square up here.
1476,Teacher,"Or, in other words, you are going to take the square root, this way. And that leaves me with five."
1483,New student,Yeah. I already knew that.
1485,Teacher,Any questions about this?
1487,New student,"Yes, but it is- no."
1489,Teacher,"No, no questions? Regardless that you say: ""yes, but""."
1494,Single student,"Oh, like that, yes, yes I got it."
1496,Teacher,"Yes, do you? Myrte?"
1498,New student,"But it says, uh, ""the other right-angled side equals the hypotenuse squared"", but do we have to take the square root of it instead of, uh, squaring it?"
1507,Teacher,"Yes. The general equation therefore is- uh, Rick, could you please go into the hallway now?"
1513,Two or more students,Bye!
1523,Teacher,"What it says here is ""one right-angled side squared plus the other right-angled side squared equals the hypotenuse squared""."
1531,Teacher,"Therefore, if you want to know what the hypotenuse is, then you have to take the root of the number representing the hypotenuse squared."
1538,New student,"Is it squared and then you have to- yes, okay."
1540,Teacher,This whole table over here shows these numbers squared.
1542,New student,Yes.
1543,Teacher,Yes? Very well.
1544,Single student,You figured it out.
1545,Teacher,"Well, in this way you can also reconstruct..."
1552,Teacher,"In this way you can also reconstruct how the A squared plus B squared equals C squared is found- gentlemen,"
1560,Teacher,I wasn't quite finished yet. You can start shortly.
1566,Teacher,"If I have a right-angled side of which I call the one side A, the other side I call B and the hypotenuse I call C,"
1573,Teacher,"and you apply the equation, then indeed you will get my first right-angled side squared."
1579,Teacher,"For example my first right-angled side is A, and you take that one squared. Plus my other right-angled side, take that one squared as well."
1588,Teacher,Equals your hypotenuse squared. And that is how most of your parents learned this.
1593,New student,Oh!
1594,Teacher,"They never had it explained to them with squares. They just learned it kind of like ""this is how it is so you better get to work with it""."
1602,New student,A squared plus B squared equals-
1606,New student,"Oh, right."
1609,Teacher,Okay.
1610,New student,(inaudible) shows the thing squared there?
1612,Teacher,Because that notion squared is the surface area that you want to calculate. The surface area of the square.
1621,New student,Like that would help!
1628,Teacher,"Okay, ladies and gentlemen. As far as the homework is concerned. Suzanne?"
1634,Teacher,"Jeffrey, Maarten?"
1639,Teacher,"So far, by way of what I showed you on the board- and I am hoping that you guys did copy it-"
1646,Teacher,we have already completed quite a lot of the exercises.
1648,Teacher,We did exercise one and we did exercise two. We haven't done exercise three yet. That's homework...
1661,New student,Hey! You are being filmed!
1673,New student,They will just edit that out.
1674,New student,That's right. Each time Ravi's head will be cut out. Yes.
1687,Teacher,You guys still have 20 minutes left.
1688,New student,Twenty. Yes. Yes.
1690,Teacher,"That means that you have to- of these exercises, be able to get as far as exercise 11. Presumably even further."
1697,Teacher,"These we haven't all done yet, those are new. The only advice I'll give you on exercise 11, a lot is written down about triangles there-"
1705,Teacher,"Sorry, Willem-"
1706,New student,The only thing (inaudible).
1707,New student,"Yes, it is fine like that."
1708,Teacher,Yes? So with exercise 11 you will only get data on what angles are 90 degrees and what the lengths are of certain sides.
1717,Teacher,Half of you are now missing this instruction.
1718,New student,"Oh, oh, sorry, you have it right here."
1720,Teacher,Annelies and Myselle? You girls are missing the instruction.
1724,New student,Shh.
1730,Teacher,Exercise 11 only states what angle is 90 degrees and what the sizes are of particular sides.
1737,Teacher,"If you want to know exactly how things are put together, make a diagram, which explains the comment at the bottom;"
1742,Teacher,make diagrams of those triangles at exercise 11 so that you know what data you've got.
1747,Teacher,"Either both of the right-angled sides will be given, or perhaps only the right-angled side and the hypotenuse will be given."
1755,Teacher,So that you can complete your calculation. Yes?
1758,New student,"Yes, understood."
1760,Teacher,"For those of you who want to check, I have answer booklets over here. You can grab those and get started now."
1778,Teacher,From now on I really want it to be quiet when I am instructing.
1779,New student,Yes.
1780,Teacher,Yes?
1781,Single student,Yes.
1782,Teacher,"You are one of the few- or one of the few, together with a few more- but there are several who want nothing but to pay attention."
1786,Single student,Yes.
1787,Teacher,"If you keep on disrupting, then you are disrupting everyone."
1788,Single student,Yes.
1789,Teacher,And certainly me.
1790,Single student,Yes.
1791,Teacher,"Just quietly get to work, the homework is on the blackboard."
1812,Teacher,"Just put it on, uh..."
1813,New student,"It doesn't make any sense, you don't feel (inaudible)."
1818,Teacher,"Yes, no, don't close it completely, just put it on- I do want some oxygen to come in."
1821,New student,Oxygen?
1822,New student,The heater is still on.
1823,Teacher,"Well, I can't turn it off, it is central heating. Otherwise I would be the first one to turn it off."
1827,New student,Here: two plus four plus six.
1839,Teacher,"Uh, ladies, ladies and gentlemen, when you are working I would like it to be more quiet. Discussions are fine but please do it in a whispering voice."
1857,New student,"He has the best-looking notebook in the whole class, of course."
1860,New student,Beautiful notebook.
1871,New student,How can you determine how much of it is tiled?
1874,Teacher,"What does it look like, the example, the diagram? How does the whole diagram look, the whole garden?"
1880,Single student,As a square.
1881,Teacher,It's an exact square.
1883,Single student,Yes?
1885,Teacher,Yes? And what is the shape of that tiled part?
1888,Single student,A triangle.
1889,Teacher,A triangle. How could we calculate again the surface area of such a triangle?
1895,Teacher,We just did that on the board on the other side.
1897,New student,"Yes, I already have it!"
1899,Teacher,"Ladies and gentlemen, the fact that I have my back turned towards you doesn't mean you are allowed to turn things upside down."
1905,New student,I agree.
1911,Teacher,"How did we do that? What can you make of this, of that one triangle?"
1914,New student,"A, uh, rectangle."
1916,Teacher,A rectangle. Yes? You can make a rectangle of this. What is the surface area then of that rectangle?
1924,Single student,Eight times six is 48.
1925,Teacher,Forty-eight. And what part of the triangle is it?
1929,Single student,I don't know.
1931,Teacher,Considering you know that the whole rectangle- because you said it's six times eight-
1933,Single student,This one is 24. Twenty-four squares (inaudible).
1935,Teacher,"Correct, is half of it. Yes?"
1938,Single student,Yes.
1939,Teacher,Okay.
1942,Teacher,"Shh! Whisper, Maarten. Maarten, whisper!"
1945,New student,I don't know it anymore.
1947,Teacher,Ladies should be whispering as well.
1949,Single student,I still don't understand G eight.
1952,Teacher,"No, right. Okay, oh. Come over here for a second."
1967,Teacher,G eight.
1970,Teacher,"What does G eight say? We have a tiler, who uses white as well as blue tiles."
1975,Single student,Yes.
1976,Teacher,Yes? The surface area of every tile is one square decimeter. The white ones as well as the blue ones.
1983,New student,Yes.
1984,Teacher,"Okay. Five tiles together make the square A B C D. A, B, C, D. What is the surface area of that square?"
1994,Single student,"Um, (inaudible)."
1997,Teacher,Sorry?
1998,Single student,Twenty-five.
1999,Teacher,Why 25? We are only looking at this one.
2010,Teacher,"You know that every tile, the white one as well as the blue one, is one square decimeter."
2013,Single student,Yes.
2014,Teacher,Yes?
2015,Single student,Five.
2016,Teacher,"So it's five, because there are five tiles in there. Yes? The surface area of this is five."
2021,Teacher,"What is the length then of A B, given the surface area of that square is five?"
2029,Single student,The square root of five.
2030,Teacher,"The square root of five. Yes? Maybe later you should add for yourself an ex- a written explanation on how you got that square root of five, okay?"
2037,Teacher,Because if later on you- you read it again you won't know how you get that square root of five.
2040,Single student,Yes.
2041,Teacher,"Yes? Now we have to fill in the length of A E, A E goes from here to there."
2047,Single student,Is two times AB .
2048,Teacher,"Yes, is two times A B. Because that section is just as long as this. And that is, then, twice?"
2054,Single student,(inaudible)
2055,Teacher,"Yes, very good, two times the square root of five."
2060,Teacher,"Very good. No, no, no, no sorry, no. We've seen that yesterday. How can we write the two differently?"
2065,Teacher,"But you don't have to do that here yet, that will come later on."
2068,Single student,(inaudible) to write the two differently?
2071,Teacher,How can I write the two into a square root? What is two equal to again?
2076,Teacher,Yesterday we had that whole list on the board.
2079,Teacher,You knew that the square root of 16 was equal to four?
2082,Single student,Yes.
2083,Teacher,Yes?
2084,Single student,"Oh, uh, it is equal to, uh, the square root of four."
2085,Teacher,"Correct, equal to the square root of four, very good. So you have the square root of four times the square root of five here."
2092,Teacher,"Look, the two was correct, but-"
2093,Single student,"Oh, yes."
2094,Teacher,It says the same. What is the outcome of this then?
2098,Teacher,"Yes! Yes, perfect. Very good. Try to do the rest of them now, too."
2103,Single student,Yes.
2104,Teacher,Yes?
2106,New student,"Look, I have a question, since yesterday I had something from chapter one-"
2109,Teacher,"Oh, yes."
2110,Single student,"And, um, look, this is, for example, um, the regular square-"
2113,Teacher,Yes?
2114,Single student,And that one is 40 square centimeters.
2118,Single student,"So the reduction goes to 10 square centimeters. Then the factor isn't four, is it?"
2122,Teacher,No.
2123,Single student,"It is two, isn't it?"
2124,Teacher,"Correct, because the surface area becomes four times smaller-"
2126,Single student,Yes.
2127,Teacher,But your magnifying factor will be the square root of that.
2131,Single student,"So if you have, for example, a really large number, for instance, uh- well, yes, I don't know, uh, for example with five numbers-"
2135,Teacher,Yes?
2136,Single student,"And, uh, it becomes a lot smaller, you have to divide it by four?"
2140,Single student,"So, uh, the magnifying factor with reduction has to be divided by four, whereas if you make it from small to large it is times four? Okay."
2147,Teacher,"Yes, correct. You were first."
2150,New student,I just have a question.
2151,Teacher,Yes?
2152,Single student,"Uh, could it also be that you only get this number?"
2155,Teacher,"Yup. Well, not only that, you need two sides at least, otherwise you cannot calculate anything. Yes?"
2159,Single student,"So this one, and that one, and then all you have to do is calculate this one here?"
2163,Single student,Okay.
2163,Teacher,Yes. Very good.
2164,Teacher,Great.
2165,New student,Where is this key on my pocket calculator?
2167,New student,"Oh, it is fine, right?"
2169,Teacher,Here. Only yours doesn't have an X below. And this is your root.
2171,Single student,So it's the same thing.
2172,Teacher,Yes. This is your root.
2173,Single student,Okay. Yes.
2197,Teacher,Was it clear for you guys?
2198,New student,Yes.
2199,Teacher,Yes? Very good.
2204,Teacher,"You keep track of this a little too, I hope?"
2205,New student,"Yes, yes, I just wrote it down."
2206,Teacher,"No, okay. Oh, okay."
2207,Single student,That's just the nature of the assignment.
2218,Teacher,Is this one clear to you guys?
2219,New student,"Yeah, sure."
2220,Teacher,Really?
2221,New student,"Yes with the explanation earlier it made it, in any case, clearer."
2222,New student,"But in the beginning it seemed a bit weird, but now I understand it."
2223,Teacher,"Yes, very good. So it is very important that it is written down properly here. Yes?"
2229,Teacher,I mean you copied it here very nicely but try to retain some of that for yourself too.
2233,Teacher,"Technically this doesn't get explained until here. So if afterwards you try to calculate the numbers, make sure you use it."
2239,Teacher,"So don't try to be stubborn or anything like that. So really try to stick to the rules, those steps. Yes?"
2244,New student,Yes.
2245,Teacher,Yes?
2246,New student,"Yes, okay."
2249,New student,The same problem.
2252,Teacher,"Three you can still do, in principle, in the old method. Because this one, the one I explained won't be explained until the next paragraph."
2260,Teacher,"But it is allowed, you'll still work through it."
2261,New student,"And, uh, the square root of (inaudible)."
2265,New student,The square root of six.
2266,New student,Yes.
2267,Teacher,"Yes, very good."
2268,Teacher,"Yes? But if you want to calculate that one, what do you need then?"
2272,Single student,"Then I can- just this one- like that? And, uh-"
2275,Teacher,"Yes, you can that way, very good. Yes, of course, only it hasn't been explained over here yet."
2280,Teacher,"But since I have already explained it and as you understand it, then, as far as I am concerned, you can go ahead and use it."
2283,Single student,Yes.
2288,Teacher,Yes?
2289,New student,If you want to measure this side-
2292,Teacher,Yes?
2293,Single student,Then you have to- this is 225.
2295,Teacher,Yes.
2296,Single student,And this is 64.
2297,Teacher,Yes.
2298,Single student,Then aren't you supposed to take two- 225 plus 64-
2301,Teacher,Yes.
2302,Single student,Is 289.
2303,Teacher,"Yes, indeed, that square-"
2304,Single student,That you have to make into a square root?
2306,Teacher,"Yes, very good."
2307,New student,"So that becomes 17, then."
2308,New student,And that is 17.
2309,Teacher,"Yes, perfect. Are you writing down what you are doing, though? Not only, uh, writing down the answers?"
2313,New student,Oh.
2319,New student,"Ehm, look here."
2324,New student,Can you see it?
2325,Teacher,"Yes, I can see it."
2326,Single student,One hundred ninety-six square meters.
2328,Teacher,What is this? What exercise are you working on?
2331,Single student,"Oh, with, um, three."
2332,Teacher,Yes? And what is this 196?
2335,Single student,That is the whole garden.
2336,Teacher,"Okay, the whole garden. Yes?"
2338,Single student,Then I have to do minus-
2339,Teacher,Yes.
2340,Single student,Twenty-four square meters.
2341,Teacher,Yes.
2342,Single student,"But doesn't that just become- can you just take this off then, like, like in the same way if there wasn't a square meter on here?"
2350,Teacher,"Yes, because- the whole garden is in square meters-"
2353,Single student,I must be confusing it with something else then.
2354,Teacher,Very small sections of square meters.
2355,Teacher,So you can easily subtract square meters from square meters.
2357,New student,Now I don't understand any of this anymore.
2359,Teacher,"Here I have the table, yes? There are square, well- let's just say meters. If I chop a piece off here, then this piece is also in square meters."
2369,Teacher,"Then this piece will remain, in square meters. That is the same thing you will do with the garden."
2374,Single student,"Yes, fine."
2375,Teacher,Yes?
2382,Teacher,Everything is clear for you guys?
2383,New student,(inaudible)
2385,Teacher,Okay.
2386,New student,This is how it should be done? Like this?
2389,Teacher,"Yes, perfect. Perfect, very nice."
2391,New student,"Of course not, are you crazy or something?"
2394,New student,But you were too warm weren't you?
2396,New student,"Yes, right, I will just go and sit here without my T-shirt, in my bare chest."
2403,Teacher,"Well, if the wind is gone, if the rain is gone then it can be opened again. I mean, uh..."
2408,New student,Then it'll get even colder.
2410,Teacher,Are you cold?
2411,New student,Yes. Very badly!
2412,New student,(inaudible) only wearing this really thin thing.
2421,Teacher,"Yes. You aren't going to infect your sister, are you?"
2424,New student,"No, she is, she is already sick."
2426,Teacher,"Yes? She is at home, though?"
2428,Single student,Yes.
2432,Teacher,"And have you changed her yet, or are you going to leave that to..."
2437,Single student,Because I did that by myself-
2439,Teacher,Yes?
2440,Single student,I am allowed to carry her into the church for the baptism.
2441,Teacher,"Oh, how neat. Oh, you don't like that?"
2444,Single student,"Well, I do think it is kind of neat and all-"
2445,New student,Yes!
2447,New student,Wow!
2452,New student,"Well, wonderful..."
2453,New student,"Really, uh, great. No, I think it is kind of neat."
2456,Teacher,Yes.
2457,New student,Do you have the answer booklets?
2458,Teacher,Yes.
2466,New student,Shirley isn't here and uh...
2467,Teacher,Sixty.
2470,New student,A B.
2471,Teacher,"No, she was sitting on Shirley's seat and that's confusing me again. I thought I finally knew all the names. Okay, thank you."
2481,Teacher,And who normally sits next to?
2484,New student,Sander.
2485,Teacher,"Oh, yes."
2486,New student,Four times the square root of 20 is eh-
2488,Teacher,"De Boer? Thank you. Easy? They were, weren't they?"
2495,Teacher,"One, two, three, four, five, six, seven... eight, nine, 10- 20. One, two, three, four, 25, 26, 27-"
2501,Teacher,"No? Yes though, it's 28, 29, it is correct."
2504,Teacher,Are you going to proceed with the work?
2509,Teacher,"Can it be a little more quiet, uh, Jeffrey? And Maarten?"
2513,New student,"We just have to calculate this one, so we have to take half."
2518,New student,And then?
2520,New student,"Well, then-"
2521,Teacher,Will you indicate how you got the numbers?
2522,New student,"Oh, yes, I will-"
2523,Teacher,"Yes? Because once again with the test I had a lot of- actually, I haven't seen yours yet, but from the other classes-"
2528,Teacher,I had to mark a lot incorrect because they only had put answers down.
2554,Teacher,Very well. My handkerchief will go into the laundry tonight. I'll need it again in a minute.
2561,New student,Sixty-four. And then this you have to add together-
2565,Teacher,No.
2566,New student,Which makes 89.
2567,Teacher,"No, they have been here on Tuesday and now."
2571,New student,What class was that then?
2573,Teacher,On Tuesday it was A 2 C.
2576,Single student,With Dennis.
2577,Teacher,Yes.
2585,New student,Teacher?
2586,Teacher,Yes?
2587,Single student,Can you check exercise three for a moment?
2589,Teacher,Of course.
2590,Single student,Because if I have that one correct then-
2591,Teacher,"Then you understand it, you mean."
2592,Single student,"Yes, because I am not sure if I understand it."
2593,Teacher,Yes. Except you have already used the new method which is explained to you in the next paragraph.
2598,Teacher,"But if you understand it, then it doesn't matter at all."
2599,Single student,"No, I took the old method, I think. Oh, no! That is the new one."
2602,Teacher,"Yes, that one won't be explained until the next paragraph."
2604,Single student,"Oh, so according to the book, I am actually working ahead."
2607,Teacher,"Yes, but that doesn't matter because the answer should be the same. All right?"
2610,New student,"Here it says: how big is the (inaudible) and here I've got five, but do you just have to (inaudible)?"
2617,Teacher,"Yes, that is correct. Because the surface area of the square is five."
2619,Single student,Yes.
2620,Teacher,"So the side, that is just one side-"
2622,Single student,Yes.
2623,Teacher,Is the root of this.
2624,Single student,"Oh, yes."
2625,Teacher,Yes? That is what we saw several times yesterday.
2627,New student,(inaudible)
2629,Teacher,Sorry?
2630,Single student,This square over here has four points-
2632,Teacher,You may draw it-
2633,Single student,(inaudible) draw it?
2634,Teacher,"No, you're not obliged to, no, you're not obliged. But if it clarifies things for yourself, then you may, of course."
2638,Teacher,But you don't have to.
2642,New student,I got it right.
2643,Teacher,"Yes, very good."
2646,Teacher,You can check it this way.
2648,New student,(inaudible)
2653,Teacher,"It should, I believe. But what, why?"
2655,Single student,How does one calculate this?
2657,Teacher,Surface area is square A E F G. How does A E F G go?
2662,Teacher,"Okay, well, what is the surface area of that?"
2666,Teacher,"How much is, what, what is the surface area again of one of these angles?"
2668,New student,Twenty.
2670,Teacher,"No, the surface area."
2671,Single student,Five.
2672,Teacher,Five. And how many of those little squares do I have in here?
2675,Single student,Four.
2676,Teacher,"Yes, so?"
2677,Single student,Twenty?
2678,Teacher,Twenty.
2679,Single student,"Yes, but I thought (inaudible)."
2681,Teacher,"Yes, that is correct. Because they are determining how you can write things in a different way."
2685,Single student,Okay.
2686,Teacher,What I explained yesterday on how you can write out those roots in different ways. Yes?
2690,Single student,"Yes, okay."
2692,New student,Heinjan and I are going to BEVO shortly.
2694,Teacher,"Yes, fine."
2695,Single student,We have a test to take.
2696,Teacher,Yup.
2698,Teacher,Yes?
2703,New student,"Hey, hey, Ravi you still have to, uh, take the test as well."
2705,New student,May I come along with you?
2709,New student,Then you have to come right now.
2720,New student,"Never mind, I'll go, I also have to go to BEVO."
2723,Teacher,"Well, then why don't you go instead? That makes a lot more sense, doesn't it?"
2734,Teacher,Ladies? Ladies?
2740,Teacher,"Well, go ahead then."
2747,Single student,Where is (inaudible)?
2748,Teacher,Just to the restroom.
2749,New student,In the rectangle one diagonal.
2761,New student,It is explained over here?
2763,Teacher,"Well, that is explained with the surfaces-"
2765,Single student,Yes.
2766,Teacher,How that works.
2767,Single student,"Oh, that is right here-"
2768,Teacher,So you can go right ahead- and now you just have to calculate this again. Yes.
2770,Single student,"Oh, with the surface area?"
2771,Teacher,"Yes, because as far as the (inaudible) diagram is concerned that doesn't get explained till over here in exercise seven."
2775,Teacher,That's why you don't have to do that one.
2776,Teacher,And then over here it is explained again and then you can continue on working.
2780,New student,"Plus five is 17- no,"
2783,New student,It is 14.
2796,Teacher,"Myrte? It was, uh, chapter one, wasn't it?"
2798,New student,Yes.
2799,New student,"Sorry, that one is wrong."
2803,Single student,This is also wrong.
2805,New student,No it's not.
2806,New student,Yes it is.
2810,New student,Don't make me cry.
2812,Teacher,Is it that bad?
2838,New student,Check your answer by measuring this in your diagram.
2847,New student,The numbers on your triangle have completely faded.
2863,Teacher,Yes?
2864,Single student,(inaudible) do wrong?
2865,Teacher,Excuse me?
2866,Single student,I don't see why this is wrong here.
2869,Teacher,What is done wrong here?
2870,Single student,Look it (inaudible) is wrong but how are you supposed to know?
2876,Teacher,What does that triangle look like? What kind of triangle is this? Why don't you make a diagram of that triangle.
2881,Single student,One like that.
2883,Teacher,"Yes, but with the sides and all, so do it with the correct- oh, you have it already. Oh, no, that is not it."
2888,Teacher,Although? Yes that's the one though. What does it say? Angle K is 90 degrees. Correct. K L is 15.
2895,Teacher,That is also correct. And then it says: L M is 25. And where did you put it? Yes?
2901,Single student,"Oh, here-"
2902,Teacher,You see? And that is what has gone wrong here too. Do you see that?
2906,Teacher,Because first you had to take a right-angled side and then another right-angled side.
2911,Teacher,That is why it is so important that you really make the right diagram with the letters in the correct place. So that you know exactly what belongs with what.
2919,Teacher,Yes?
2924,Teacher,"Ladies and gentlemen, it is almost time, so you can start to pack."
2929,Teacher,Yes?
2932,New student,"Is it- if you, uh, write it down like this because you have to measure the other right-angled side-"
2940,Teacher,Yes?
2941,Single student,"Then is this, uh, correct then, because, uh-"
2943,Teacher,The calculation is correct but you still have to answer it.
2946,Teacher,"Because now we have to search, no, you don't have to explain anything."
2950,Teacher,"Because now I have to search for your answer. Like do I need 41 or do I need 40, or do I need nine?"
2955,Single student,Yes?
2956,Teacher,"I need to know what you calculated. Then you can just say the other side is- well, what did you calculate? Forty."
2961,Single student,Yup.
2962,Teacher,Yes? So you still have to give an answer because otherwise I will have to search in such a diagram.
2965,Single student,Yup.
2966,Teacher,And you know that I will always find the wrong one.
