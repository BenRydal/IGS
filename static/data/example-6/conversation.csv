4,Teacher,How about today?
9,Teacher,Good morning.
10,New student,Stand up.
15,Single student,Bow.
17,Single student,Sit down.
22,Teacher,Okay. It's supposed to be as usual so let's go on without being concerned about it.
32,Teacher,Anyway your face might not be taped.
34,Two or more students,[Laughter]
35,Teacher,"In reality, there might be dark lines in your faces."
37,Two or more students,[Laughter]
39,Teacher,Don't worry.
45,Teacher,Okay.
48,Teacher,Ahh.
53,Teacher,"Okay, yesterday was about the relationship between parallel lines. We ended quickly yesterday by doing some problems."
60,Teacher,Do you remember what they were?
87,Teacher,"The first written problem on the handout we hurried through it yesterday, so we were not able to summarize it well at the end..."
95,Teacher,So today in between the parallel lines there is one angle in the bend.
103,Teacher,So first we will obtain that angle.
106,Teacher,When I had you do the problems yesterday we had three problem solving methods that were presented...
111,Teacher,It's okay to use the method you think is the easiest. Please try to do the problem.
152,Teacher,"After you have finished writing, please add an explanation."
157,Teacher,My- my method is this and this way. If you can also give an explanation that would be amazing.
216,Teacher,"This, right."
218,Teacher,You're fast.
234,Teacher,"If you forgot how to solve it, it is okay to look at the previous handout."
246,Teacher,(inaudible) let me borrow this for me. Let me borrow this because he needs a pencil. It's a little different... line... (inaudible).
262,Teacher,Umm. Okay.
266,Teacher,Are you done? Can I ask? How is it?
272,Write on blackboard,[Blackboard: Method of investigating the diagram. Diagram bends once between the parallel lines.]
272,Teacher,People who solved it?
275,Teacher,Okay then... Arai.
280,New student,Yes.
282,Teacher,"Okay, what did you do?"
283,Single student,Fifty. The 50 degree. The line around it. The line there extend it.
290,Teacher,Okay. Did you extend it like this?
293,Single student,Bring that over there. Uh- 50 degrees. Alternate interior angles of it. There. That is 50 degrees so.
303,Teacher,This? Okay.
306,Single student,The right angle is 30 degrees. If you add it all up it becomes 180 degrees so.
312,Teacher,A triangle. Yes.
313,Single student,Yes. The top part is 100 degrees.
318,Single student,"The one before. A right angle is. A right angle is. Um, it becomes 180 degrees so."
319,Teacher,Okay. Not a straight line?
325,Single student,A straight line becomes 180 degrees
326,Teacher,Yes.
329,Single student,So X is 80.
332,Teacher,Okay. Is this okay? Here we go. Okay. We can see he was a little tense.
338,Teacher,"Um, that was a clear method. People who did it using this method?"
343,Teacher,Oh... okay.
348,Teacher,"About five people? Okay, other methods."
352,Teacher,"Okay, Bunya."
356,Teacher,"Okay, please go ahead."
358,Single student,In the middle.
360,Single student,Draw a... parallel line.
367,Teacher,Oops? Okay.
368,Single student,"Then. Um, the top 50 degrees, the alternate interior angles of that."
374,Teacher,Yes.
375,Single student,It is made there so.
377,Teacher,"Yes, well- Well, okay."
381,Single student,So it's 50 degrees.
383,Single student,The bottom is 30 degrees. It can also be done in the same way.
388,Single student,Add those together it becomes 80 degrees.
391,Teacher,Okay. That's good. The method was to use the alternate interior angles of the parallel lines.
397,Teacher,Good. People who did it with this same method?
401,Teacher,Okay.
402,Teacher,Right. About 10 people. Okay.
407,Teacher,Are there any other methods?
410,Teacher,Oh. One person... Chika.
414,New student,Yes.
415,Teacher,Okay.
416,Single student,"Umm, from point B."
418,Teacher,From point B. Okay.
419,Single student,From point B.
420,Teacher,Okay.
421,Single student,Is it... L?
424,Teacher,"From the top line it would be an L, huh."
425,Single student,To the top straight line draw a perpendicular line. Then-
429,Teacher,Draw a perpendicular line from point B.
431,Single student,"Then. The B area is 60 degrees. Umm- well not really B, but between that perpendicular line and 30 degrees is a right angle."
442,Single student,So subtract 30 degrees from 90 degrees.
444,Teacher,Yes.
445,Single student,It becomes 60 degrees.
446,Teacher,Yes.
447,Single student,The area A is fi- fifty degrees so.
452,Single student,"Umm, the straight line is 180 degrees."
456,Teacher,Right.
457,Single student,Angle A becomes 130 degrees.
462,Single student,Since if you add up all of the angles of a quadrilateral it becomes 360 degrees.
467,Single student,"Umm, if you add- what is this? It becomes 280 degrees. Eight."
475,Single student,Subtract 280 degrees from 360 degrees. X became 80 degrees.
480,Teacher,Okay. Yes. Here we go. Okay. People with the same method as this?
488,Teacher,Oh. Just Doi. Okay. Good. Are there any more?
494,Teacher,Think a little more.
497,New student,I'm thinking.
498,Teacher,Okay? I am sure there are people who also extended this one.
503,Teacher,Here are methods like that. Basically these three are the ones you have thought of.
509,Teacher,Now I will summarize these into main points.
515,Teacher,With just this diagram... with just this diagram we can't solve the problem.
521,Teacher,So Sano and others extended the line to make a triangle. Bunya and others drew in a parallel line in the middle.
529,Teacher,Chika and others drew in a perpendicular line. That means we can't solve it without auxiliary lines.
552,Teacher,The auxiliary lines become important.
555,Teacher,"Then by the way we draw the auxiliary lines in all we got three types. Sano's, Bunya's, Chika's."
561,Write on blackboard,[Blackboard: Point: Auxiliary line is important]
565,Teacher,They were different based on the way the auxiliary lines were drawn.
568,Teacher,"That means, one way is to draw a parallel line and use the alternate interior angles."
577,Teacher,"Another is to extend the line and make... a triangle,"
582,Teacher,and use the fact that the sum of the angles of a triangle is 180 degrees.
589,Teacher,And Chika used the method that if we add the four angles of...
596,Teacher,a quadrilateral we get 360 degrees. These are the three we got.
599,Write on blackboard,[Blackboard: One: Parallel lines. Two: Triangle. Three: Quadrangle.]
603,Teacher,"Now then, any method was okay, but the task was to do it using the easiest method."
610,Teacher,And each person seemed to have selected one out of the three we summarized yesterday.
614,Teacher,Today's problems are ones that can't be solved without auxiliary lines. We want to do problems of this kind.
621,Teacher,Today. The way this problem is made is that
625,Teacher,it is a problem of an angle bent once between parallel lines. The angle is bent once between parallel lines.
636,Teacher,"Today by changing this condition, by changing this condition-"
641,Teacher,I will have you make your own problems. And today we won't change the parallel lines.
650,Teacher,"We won't change the parallel lines, but rather the middle. Change the middle means-"
654,New student,Outside.
655,Teacher,Oh. It's okay with the outside. The outside can be good. Now it has one bend.
662,Teacher,It is even okay to bend it twice. I don't want you to bend it ten times.
665,Two or more students,[Laughter]
668,New student,Eda (inaudible).
669,New student,Eda difficult.
670,Teacher,There are always at least two or three of you thinking about it?
672,Two or more students,[Laughter]
675,Teacher,I know there will be some. But twice or three times. That's the limit.
681,Teacher,"After that nobody will understand it. You may be creative in between and change the number of bends, or,"
686,Teacher,"it is also okay to use the outside with one bend, or it is also okay to be outside with two bends."
692,Teacher,Please think by yourselves. You can't just go and bend it 10 times. Don't draw random squiggly lines. That is not good.
698,Teacher,"Okay, umm, I have prepared two on your handout, but one is okay."
705,Teacher,If it's easy please do two. It is okay to bend twice or be outside.
711,Teacher,"Then put in angles by yourselves and write in which angle is X, the one we need to obtain."
737,Teacher,"Oh, if 30 students do it, if they made only one problem each we will have 30 problems."
747,Teacher,It's actually pretty hard to put in the degrees. You can't just put in any degrees.
753,New student,Do we also write the (inaudible).
763,Teacher,When you turn it in you must be able to solve it.
767,Teacher,If somebody says he or she doesn't understand it you must be able to say what and why the problem is.
771,Teacher,Please think about how the problem can be understood.
787,New student,(inaudible)
790,New student,A moment.
791,New student,Mmm.
794,New student,Wait a minute.
801,New student,(inaudible)
809,New student,"Um? This one, too?"
819,Teacher,Which one?
820,Write on blackboard,[Blackboard: Subject: Let's try to make our own problems with different conditions.]
835,New student,Huh?
836,Teacher,"Um- by yourself. It isn't okay if you try to solve it yourself and find it can be solved, right?"
868,Teacher,"These are the same, since there is only one bend between the parallel lines, it's the same as this."
875,Teacher,Try to change it.
880,Teacher,"Oh, it looks difficult."
884,Teacher,It looks pretty tough.
892,Teacher,This also looks difficult.
903,Teacher,"You can put the bends in, but does the number fit in, is the problem."
916,New student,Isn't it-
921,Teacher,It has to be a problem you can solve.
933,Teacher,It can be the second one or the outside.
938,Teacher,"Bam, bam, and it can be bent on the outside. Or you can bend it once, twice."
947,New student,(inaudible) Just one?
961,New student,Whichever equals.
962,Teacher,"If you make it too hard, well it'll be... stressful."
972,Teacher,"How many times is this bent? One, two, three, four times it has been bent. It's been bent too many times."
982,New student,Is this okay for the first one?
983,Teacher,What?
984,Single student,Is this okay for the first one?
986,Teacher,You can't solve this.
987,Single student,What?
988,Teacher,Without another angle I don't think it can't be solved.
990,Single student,What?
994,Teacher,If you try to solve it and you can solve it yourself then it is okay.
1006,New student,Isn't it difficult? This is difficult.
1015,New student,If you have finished.
1017,Teacher,Where do you solve for this?
1019,Single student,Hum?
1020,Teacher,Where do you solve for this problem?
1021,Single student,"For this, it is for this."
1022,Teacher,Here?
1023,Teacher,Then what is this?
1025,Single student,(inaudible)
1027,Teacher,There's a reason for this.
1029,Teacher,It starts at point A and goes through point B and-
1032,Single student,"Ah, I see."
1036,Teacher,"Ahh, it looks hard."
1038,New student,This is simple.
1040,Teacher,"Ahh, it is hard."
1041,Single student,(inaudible) like these.
1045,Single student,Like this.
1048,Teacher,This looks hard.
1049,Single student,This is 90 degrees.
1050,Teacher,"Oh, I made a mistake. This is going to be hard."
1054,Single student,This 65 degrees is last.
1059,New student,"Eventually, if you extend it here is 62. This is 180 degrees."
1063,Single student,"Two hundred, 220."
1070,New student,Ah.
1072,New student,Is this 62 degrees?
1074,New student,There.
1076,New student,"Here, lend it to me."
1083,New student,One hundred twenty.
1087,New student,(inaudible)
1090,New student,At 15 you can do it.
1113,Teacher,Are you done writing? Are you finished?
1149,Teacher,It seems hard.
1152,Teacher,Let's try hard to do one problem. Try hard to make one problem.
1171,New student,Understand.
1176,New student,Okay?
1196,Teacher,"Um, if you put it on the inside maybe it'll be easier to solve."
1201,Teacher,Wow. This is how you take off from A and bend and reach B. What does that mean for A?
1213,Teacher,This is fine.
1218,Teacher,Is it solvable?
1219,New student,You can solve this.
1220,Teacher,It is solvable.
1221,Single student,Yes.
1222,Teacher,It won't be solvable without these angles here.
1224,Single student,"What? Add this, like this?"
1225,Teacher,Where?
1226,Single student,Like this. If you extend it... it's 60 degrees.
1234,Teacher,Where?
1238,Single student,"This, isn't this 60 degrees, this... like this isn't 60 degrees?"
1242,Teacher,That doesn't work if this and this are not parallel.
1247,New student,If you draw a parallel line.
1249,New student,If you draw a parallel line.
1250,Teacher,If this and this are not parallel then this angle is not 60 degrees.
1255,Single student,"This angle, too... can't be used under that assumption?"
1259,Teacher,No. If they're parallel lines then just put in the symbol for parallel lines here. (inaudible)
1276,New student,Thank you very much.
1279,New student,I don't know if they'll understand this.
1281,Teacher,It looks a little tough. This is too difficult.
1283,Single student,(inaudible)
1285,Teacher,And right... I made it too difficult. I made it too difficult.
1292,New student,Here it's hard.
1326,Teacher,If there isn't an angle here it can't be understood. Just put something in.
1341,Teacher,You guys seemed to have learned that any number just doesn't fit in.
1345,Teacher,You guys seemed to have learned that any number just doesn't fit in.
1366,Teacher,"How many bends are there? One, two, three, four, five bends."
1370,Teacher,If you don't make it at most three then it will be impossible.
1373,New student,I understand.
1391,New student,(inaudible)
1391,Teacher,Let's see. What time?
1392,Teacher,Well it seems it was a little hard. I made a mistake. There are many of you that are in trouble.
1400,Teacher,"Well there are not that many people with one, two done, but there seems to be a lot of people with one done,so,"
1404,Teacher,get in your groups and... from the problems you have made...
1413,Teacher,"pick a problem you and others think is challenging, and group leaders please bring them up here."
1441,Teacher,Please check if the problem can be really solved and then bring it up.
1461,Teacher,One problem is enough.
1463,Teacher,There are problems that can't be solved.
1483,New student,How about this one? This?
1486,New student,Th- Th- This (inaudible).
1497,Teacher,(inaudible) It seems hard.
1503,Teacher,Can't it be solved?
1506,Teacher,You don't have to make a new problem at this point.
1509,Teacher,Just from the currents ones you have.
1519,Teacher,This is a good problem.
1520,New student,Is it good?
1523,Teacher,"Yes, because it's two bends, and the bends are different."
1527,Teacher,"And this is also a good problem, whether you can do it or not, change that part. Not too much."
1536,New student,Up to number two?
1556,New student,(inaudible) a quadrilateral.
1559,New student,Ha ha. Indeed.
1561,New student,A quadrilateral. A quadrilateral? (inaudible)
1573,Teacher,Who made this?
1574,New student,Masa-
1575,New student,Hara.
1579,Teacher,Umm.
1580,New student,You can't solve it.
1583,Teacher,Mmm. Can they do it or not?
1605,Teacher,Yes.
1614,Teacher,"Hey, let's bring up one."
1624,Teacher,"Ha, it looks like a hard one."
1625,Teacher,Whose is it?
1626,New student,(inaudible)
1627,Teacher,From which group?
1628,Single student,From group number five.
1629,Teacher,This one?
1630,Single student,Right.
1631,Teacher,Group five.
1641,Teacher,Ah.
1656,New student,It's a hard one.
1662,Teacher,"Oh, the diagram was too small."
1665,New student,You're completely wrong. Do you know what you are doing?
1670,New student,This part is easy.
1675,Teacher,Here.
1676,New student,Here teacher.
1677,Teacher,This- which group?
1678,Single student,This one.
1679,Teacher,This can't be used.
1680,Single student,It can't?
1681,Teacher,Uh huh. Because this is bent many times.
1682,Teacher,Yes.
1683,Single student,Teacher. This one.
1684,Teacher,Just a little more- this is too hard.
1686,Single student,He said it was too hard.
1688,Teacher,"Oh, it looks like a good problem. What group?"
1691,New student,Group one.
1692,Teacher,Group one?
1699,Teacher,Group one?
1700,Single student,Group one.
1707,Teacher,The diagram is a little...
1731,Teacher,Here.
1736,Teacher,Which number?
1737,New student,Number four.
1738,Teacher,Number four- can you really solve it?
1741,Single student,That can be solved easily.
1742,Single student,We can.
1743,Single student,It seems.
1746,Teacher,Is this all?
1747,Single student,Yes.
1774,Teacher,"Okay, that's good. Yes."
1778,Teacher,"Next, who's next?"
1781,New student,It's easy. That one.
1784,Teacher,"Don't say anything yet. Don't say anything. Groups that have not yet brought up one, please hurry up."
1794,New student,"Teacher, I solved this."
1797,Teacher,I wonder.
1798,Single student,It can- it can be solved teacher.
1801,Teacher,Can this be solved?
1802,Single student,I believe it can be solved.
1806,Teacher,I think it is impossible.
1807,Single student,Impossible?
1809,Single student,"This one, this one."
1810,Teacher,Which one?
1811,Single student,"This one, this one. (inaudible)"
1813,Teacher,Mm. It's probably right?
1819,Teacher,"Which one is that, group three?"
1820,Single student,Group three.
1826,New student,The second time is hard but easy.
1837,Single student,"Number one is easy, too."
1850,Teacher,Now number four is left.
1861,Teacher,Which number?
1862,New student,Number four.
1863,Teacher,Number four?
1864,New student,"Number four. It might be complex. Right, it's different. It might be complex, okay?"
1868,Teacher,"I'll do number four just a little. Sorry, okay?"
1892,Teacher,Can it be solved?
1893,New student,It can be solved.
1894,Teacher,You're able to solve it? Hum
1896,Teacher,Hum oh.
1899,Teacher,Oh.
1902,Teacher,What number?
1905,Teacher,Hum. Okay.
1908,Teacher,They are problems that we don't know if we can solve or not until we try.
1914,Teacher,"I'm sorry for taking so much time, but there are six problems on the right side."
1926,Teacher,(inaudible) if we can solve it or not.
1931,Teacher,I wonder.
1940,Teacher,"It seems impossible to do all of them in this time so. So we'll think about them a little next time, too."
1956,Teacher,Please hurry up and copy the six problems.
1964,Teacher,Imai is X here?
1970,Teacher,Hum. (inaudible)
1974,New student,"Oh, I got it."
1977,New student,Can you solve it?
1978,New student,I got it. I got it.
1989,Teacher,"They really seem challenging, huh?"
1992,Teacher,There seems to be one that is too challenging.
1994,New student,(inaudible)
1999,Teacher,"They are really challenging, like eating a dried squid."
2004,Two or more students,[Laughter]
2007,Teacher,"Umm, this one is not that bad."
2017,Teacher,Umm... I'll say it's like a piece of gum.
2024,Two or more students,Gum.
2025,Two or more students,Gum.
2026,Two or more students,Gu-gum.
2027,New student,"Oh, group two's, group two's, the one on the top."
2030,Teacher,Umm. Group four.
2041,Teacher,This is a rock.
2043,Two or more students,[Laughter]
2045,New student,Then this is a rock.
2071,Teacher,Umm. Um um um.
2092,New student,Rice cracker.
2093,New student,Number five. Number five.
2094,Write on blackboard,[Blackboard: Rice Cracker].
2095,New student,Isn't it easy?
2099,New student,"Rock, it's a rock."
2105,Teacher,"Then I'm sorry there isn't much time, but there are six problems."
2110,Teacher,There may be ones from your own group. There may be ones that are yours. Please copy them.
2115,Teacher,It can be from number one. It can also be from the hardest one.
2121,New student,(inaudible) This is gum.
2146,Teacher,That means since today's problems can't be solved without auxiliary lines...
2150,Teacher,what kind of auxiliary lines. It can't be solved without auxiliary lines.
2156,Two or more students,Gum.
2158,Teacher,If you need the auxiliary lines the problem is what kind of auxiliary lines should you use.
2163,Teacher,"There were three, but which one is the easiest way to do it."
2189,Teacher,For now please finish copying the problems by 35 after the hour.
2195,Teacher,I think... the answers will be given next period.
2201,Teacher,What shall I do?
2203,New student,Huh?
2204,Teacher,Can you solve this?
2205,Single student,I don't know.
2209,New student,This is well... this is really hard.
2230,Teacher,Genji's symbol is good. It's there nicely working.
2320,Teacher,Are there any groups that were able to solve them?
2323,New student,Plus 15.
2328,New student,"(inaudible) since it's 15 degrees, so 90. Ooh."
2332,Teacher,Not so (inaudible).
2334,Teacher,Oh- the rice cracker hard problem seems to be solved.
2337,New student,(inaudible) fifteen. It's 30 degrees.
2339,New student,Teacher. Fifteen.
2341,New student,"Fifteen, 15, 30, 90, 90."
2342,New student,"It's not 90, 90. Ooh."
2343,New student,Ninety-nine?
2344,New student,One hundred.
2345,New student,Hundred.
2346,New student,Plus.
2347,New student,(inaudible)
2351,Single student,It's correct. We got this. We solved this.
2359,New student,The rock?
2360,Teacher,Later. We'll check it later.
2363,Teacher,We'll check it later.
2371,New student,"No, at the time- at the time I was solving it I was thinking that I couldn't solve it."
2414,Teacher,I didn't write the group names.
2429,Write on blackboard,[Blackboard: Gum]
2433,Write on blackboard,[Blackboard: Stone]
2434,Write on blackboard,[Blackboard: Dried Squid]
2435,Teacher,Since all of them are challenging we can't solve it just like that. Let's do it step by step.
2443,Teacher,People who are done solving the problem from group one?
2447,Teacher,Okay good. Group two's?
2450,Teacher,"A little more. Straight. Raise your hands straight. Ahh, about the same. Group three's?"
2457,Teacher,Oh. Group four's?
2460,Teacher,Okay. Group five's?
2463,Teacher,Okay. Group six's?
2465,Teacher,Really. Group six's. Okay good.
2468,New student,Number six is easy so-
2470,New student,(inaudible)
2472,New student,There is an even harder one.
2474,New student,This one seems more likely to work out.
2482,New student,"I haven't gotten this one yet, but-"
2486,New student,It's hard?
2487,New student,I just finally got it.
2524,Teacher,Is it group one or group two?
2525,New student,One hundred eighty degrees?
2526,Teacher,Umm.
2527,New student,Is this 40?
2528,Teacher,Umm.
2529,New student,Forty degrees.
2535,New student,One hundred twenty degrees.
2536,New student,One hundred twenty degrees.
2538,New student,Why is that? (inaudible) Isn't this 47? Right here.
2556,Teacher,This is easier. Umm. This one symbol. If you miss that one symbol...
2563,Teacher,you can't solve the problem. This is parallel. This and this are parallel. Without that you can't solve it.
2574,Teacher,That's right. That's right. That's right. If you do that. It's about done.
2603,Teacher,Group one's is hard. I think group one's is really hard.
2628,Teacher,How you draw the auxiliary lines makes the difference. Something...
2637,New student,One hundred ninety. This is 190.
2647,New student,Number eight. Number two. Number eight. Number eight. (inaudible)
2659,Teacher,"Okay, do you want to try it again?"
2668,Teacher,I'll give you a hint. Try extending this further. Try extending the auxiliary line further.
2685,New student,Teacher.
2693,Teacher,Try this one. This one is easier. There is a symbol included here. This parallel symbol.
2705,Teacher,Extend the auxiliary line all the way to here. Try extending it.
2715,Teacher,"Yes, yes."
2718,Teacher,This and this are parallel. If you use (inaudible) angles this angle becomes the (inaudible).
2725,Teacher,This is a straight line so you know it. So you somehow get this angle.
2756,Teacher,You know this angle and this angle (inaudible). If you write in as much as you know...it'll work.
2778,Teacher,"Oh that's good. They're the right auxiliary lines. Umm. Ahh, this is (inaudible). This is hard. You can't solve it without auxiliary lines."
2790,Teacher,That's good.
2793,Teacher,"Umm, 120 degrees and then the straight line."
2800,Teacher,"Like this line and like this, use auxiliary lines and try drawing it. It's good to draw auxiliary lines."
2808,New student,Man. This one is amazing.
2818,Teacher,"Umm, I see."
2844,New student,Do it one more time.
2845,New student,I did it once.
2846,New student,A mistake.
2847,New student,Uh I thought it was wrong. (inaudible)
2849,Teacher,Umm um. That it. That's it. That's it.
2887,Teacher,(inaudible)? (inaudible)
2892,Teacher,"Umm, that one."
2898,Teacher,"Umm, um, um. Divide it around here. It's the auxiliary lines. Auxilary lines. It's a lot different with another auxiliary line."
2909,Teacher,"But even if you didn't get the last one, you got this one, right? This and this are parallel,"
2917,Teacher,"and here and here are corresponding angles, and you get here. You got there and with that..."
2950,Teacher,"This is going to be a little bothersome but, well, I want to know the present situation. People who are done with group one's?"
2958,Teacher,You solved it?
2962,Teacher,Umm. Group two's?
2967,Teacher,"Oh, okay. Group three's?"
2972,Teacher,"Um, okay. Group four's?"
2975,Teacher,Up to where did you get to? Um. Group five's?
2980,Teacher,Hum. Two people. This was a hard one. Umm. So that's it. Group six's?
2985,New student,Group six's was simple.
2986,New student,It was very troublesome.
2988,Teacher,Okay.
2989,New student,Did you do it?
2990,Teacher,(inaudible) Okay then there are a lot of people who are using triangles.
3000,Other,[Bell]
3001,Teacher,"That's okay, but- There were three types of auxiliary lines. There are other easier methods of solving..."
3011,Teacher,using other types of auxiliary lines. We will check these in the next period.
3016,Teacher,Return to your desks.
3032,New student,Never.
3033,New student,You can never do this one.
3038,Teacher,Who got group four's? Who said he or she got group four's?
3041,Teacher,Fujita Today. Okay.
3046,Teacher,Please end the class. There's no math class tomorrow so let's check them the day after tomorrow. Okay.
3050,New student,Do we have math the day after tomorrow?
3053,Teacher,We have math class the day after tomorrow right?
3058,New student,The day after tomorrow is Thursday.
3061,New student,Thursday.
3062,New student,Did it change?
3063,Teacher,Thursday?
3064,Teacher,The day after tomorrow is Friday.
3066,Two or more students,Huh?
3067,Teacher,Today is what day of the week?
3069,Teacher,Tuesday?
3070,New student,Today is Tuesday.
3071,Teacher,Tomorrow?
3072,Two or more students,Wednesday.
3073,Teacher,Day after tomorrow?
3074,Two or more students,Thursday.
3075,Teacher,That's right. I got it. Okay.
3077,Teacher,Go ahead.
3079,New student,Stand up. Bow.
