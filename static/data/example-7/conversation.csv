time,speaker,talk
0,Teacher,(inaudible) four. One for each group of four. Okay? Or three. Okay?
6,Teacher,"Okay guys, let's get started here. Okay, listen closely."
11,Teacher,To save a little time I won't bring out my overhead like you're usually accustomed to.
14,New student,Dear...
15,New student,Thank you.
16,Teacher,"Okay? Instead, let me just tell you."
19,Teacher,What I'm going to give you for each group is a little three-page packet. Okay?
26,Teacher,"What I need for you to do right now is, every one of you get out a blank sheet of paper. Every one of you needs a blank sheet of paper."
35,New student,Thank you.
38,Single student,"Ashley, can I have a piece of paper?"
41,Teacher,"Just put it right on the table back there, (inaudible)."
43,Single student,Thank you.
58,Teacher,"Thank you Sarah. Don't leave without it, all right."
61,New student,"Oh, (inaudible)."
62,Teacher,Okay. Now- Here you go.
71,Teacher,All right.
73,Teacher,"Okay, so... listen closely now. Everybody ready?"
78,Single student,Yep.
80,Teacher,"Okay, everybody within your group of four or three, you need to work together. I know normally we work in pairs."
87,Teacher,Okay? But I figured today you have another pair of students-
93,Teacher,"You know, a couple of extra brains there to help you get through this little lesson. Okay? We've done this plenty of times before."
101,Teacher,"Some of you honestly are still a little shaky. So, if you look at the packet which you are all sharing as a group-"
109,Teacher,"Page one has five equations I want you to graph. Now you can graph it any way that you know how to do it, as long as you do it correctly."
120,Teacher,Can someone raise their hand and tell me what's one obvious thing that I can do to graph? Nick?
124,New student,The slope.
125,Teacher,Use the slope with the?
127,New student,Y intercept and X intercept.
128,Teacher,"Y intercept. Right? That's probably the way you'll probably want to do it, right Nick?"
131,Single student,Yeah.
132,Teacher,"Is there another way, though? Robert?"
135,New student,"Use the, um, tables."
136,Teacher,"Right, to make a table for the equation, right? And then plot the points from the table. Everyone got that?"
141,Teacher,"So those are the two main ways, right, we can graph those equations? So right now I need you to get started."
147,Teacher,"The key thing is when you're done with the first five, the first page, as noted on the paper, please make sure I check to make-"
155,Teacher,Make sure you did it right before you move on. Okay? So go ahead and get started.
162,Teacher,"Nick, question?"
163,New student,"Where's the... oh, right here?"
164,Teacher,Yeah. You're going to graph on that. That is your result for your group.
168,Single student,"So everybody has to do one graph, right?"
169,Teacher,Right.
170,Teacher,So someone here can assign themselves as the grapher or whatever.
174,Teacher,"The rest of you kind of work together to make sure it's accurate. Okay? You going to do it? Good job, Nick."
181,Teacher,Yes?
183,Teacher,"All right, the grid paper- All right, you know what? Hey, listen up real quick."
187,Teacher,"Five, four, three, two, one, zero. I probably forgot 'cause I'm still a little nervous. Okay?"
194,Teacher,"But the grid paper, you have one per group. Right?"
199,Teacher,So I'm relying on one of you in that group to be the designated grapher for the group.
205,Teacher,"But the rest of you please help out- you know, help each other. Get the graphs done correctly. Okay?"
215,Teacher,"There you go, Robert. So while he's doing that, let's get started on this, guys. What are we going to do?"
219,New student,Do we write this on our piece of paper?
220,Teacher,Yeah.
221,Single student,"Oh, okay."
222,Teacher,"All right? This is actually the- use the ruler, Robert. Use the ruler man. Make it neat. All right?"
228,New student,"Mr. Ormsby, you know, when you put, like, a one in here, would you go like, times-"
233,Teacher,"Ah, see, so now you've already forgotten, right? First of all zeros are our favorite number, right?"
238,Single student,Yeah.
239,Teacher,You put in zero. Two-thirds times zero is what?
242,Single student,Zero.
243,Teacher,Plus eight is?
244,Single student,Eight.
245,Teacher,"Eight. Now because this fraction is a two-thirds, do you remember what I told you what numbers you should pick now?"
251,Single student,"Um, threes."
253,Teacher,"All right. So maybe zero, three and six would be good numbers to try with this one, right?"
258,Teacher,That way you don't have to worry about fractions and mixed numbers.
259,Single student,Okay.
260,Teacher,Okay? All right.
262,New student,"Mr. Ormsby, whoo-hoo. Okay. Mister, I forgot how to do these again. Like how do you do X and Y?"
269,Teacher,"Okay, so now wait a minute. You want to make a table then, right? So you're going to make an X Y table, okay?"
276,Teacher,"Now... the idea again is, to make our points we just pick any number we want for X."
282,Teacher,"We can do that, right? Everybody agree? Jenna?"
285,New student,Yeah.
286,New student,"So it was zero, one, two and-"
287,Teacher,"Ah, that's true, except because this is a two-thirds fraction-"
292,Single student,You want to pick three as like-
293,Teacher,Exactly.
294,Single student,"Negative three, zero and three."
296,Teacher,"Right, and if you want to just do zero, three, six and stay away from negatives, you can do that too. All right?"
301,New student,I got six (inaudible) in the middle.
303,New student,"So, zero, three, six."
304,New student,I get six.
306,Teacher,Right.
307,Single student,Okay.
308,Teacher,And you think you can do it on your own now? You just want to be on the camera. Okay.
313,Single student,"No, that's not true."
314,Teacher,"Okay, we're going to put in zero here, right?"
317,Single student,Okay.
318,Teacher,What's two-thirds times zero?
319,Single student,Zero.
320,Teacher,"Everybody watching, right? Plus eight is?"
322,Single student,Eight.
323,Teacher,Eight.
324,Single student,So three times two is six.
326,Teacher,Six.
327,Single student,Divided by three is two.
328,Teacher,Three is two.
330,Single student,Plus eight is-
331,Teacher,Eight is?
332,Single student,Ten. Okay I get it. Thank you Mr. Ormsby.
333,Teacher,Okay. Good job.
334,Single student,So six times-
336,New student,"All right, so, okay, this is what I did. I put three negative three, zero, three and six, all right?"
337,Teacher,Okay.
341,Teacher,How come you have your table backwards? I've never done that before.
343,Single student,"Well, I did that."
344,Teacher,Okay.
345,New student,It's easier this way.
346,New student,It's easier.
347,Teacher,"All right, if you say so."
348,Single student,"Anyways, I put negative three, so, I put two-thirds and then-"
353,Teacher,Times negative three.
354,Single student,"Yeah. Negative three goes in the top, right?"
356,Teacher,"Right. Well, you- negative three, you remember, is negative three over one. There you go."
360,Single student,"So- so it's a one and a one. But that's a negative still, right?"
363,Teacher,Right. That's still a negative there.
364,Single student,So it's negative two?
365,New student,So it's negative two.
366,Teacher,Plus eight is?
368,New student,Six.
369,Teacher,Yeah.
370,Single student,"See, I knew that."
371,Teacher,"So negative three is six, zero is eight. Now three I question, though. Try a positive three."
377,New student,Cause they're both positive so-
379,New student,"Two-third so, three, one-"
380,New student,Oh.
381,Teacher,Okay.
382,New student,"One one, and then three, eight, 11."
386,Teacher,"No, wait a minute. Wait a minute."
387,Single student,Two. One is-
388,New student,And five.
389,Teacher,"Two plus- wait a minute, no, you were ""times-ing"" it."
390,New student,Oh.
391,New student,It's two so-
392,New student,It's 10.
393,New student,Yeah.
394,Teacher,It's 10. And then six is 12.
395,New student,It's six then 10 and 12.
396,New student,Okay.
398,Teacher,All right. Yes?
399,New student,"All right, I just totally forgot um, you know, how to do the graph."
403,Teacher,"Okay, now what I liked- you at least remember to use multiples. Like this one- Let's try this one right here. All right?"
409,Single student,Okay.
410,Teacher,"You remembered to use fives, but let's try zero. If I put in zero there, what's three-fifths times zero?"
415,Single student,Um... zero?
417,Teacher,Right. Minus 10.
419,Single student,Is negative 10?
420,Teacher,"So put a negative 10 there. So now you're going to- now try five in there, right?"
425,Single student,Okay.
426,Teacher,So just write a little five there so you can mentally see it. So if I do three times five that's?
431,Single student,Fifteen.
432,Teacher,"Now remember I'm going to divide by the five, which gives me?"
434,Single student,Three.
435,Teacher,Minus 10.
438,Single student,Negative seven.
439,Teacher,Good job. I think you got it now.
441,Single student,"Oh, okay."
442,New student,Mr. Ormsby?
442,Teacher,All right. Finish it up.
443,Teacher,All right.
444,New student,"Uh, how many points do you want us to plot? Three or four?"
447,Teacher,"Well that's a very good question. Obviously, how many points do I really need to make a line?"
451,Single student,Two.
452,Teacher,Two. Right? But just to make sure-
454,Single student,Three.
455,Teacher,Plot at least three points.
457,Single student,Okay.
458,Teacher,That way if they're all in a line you know you did it right. Okay?
461,New student,Mr. Ormsby.
462,Teacher,Yeah?
465,Single student,I made the graph.
466,Teacher,"Use the whole paper, man. Look at these big grid lines here. Everyone, make it count one. Okay?"
473,Single student,Don't we have to use- use graph- graph every single one of those?
476,Teacher,"Yeah, you're going to graph these five. That's why I want you to use the whole paper. Make a big coordinate system."
480,Single student,Oh.
481,Teacher,As a matter of fact- Let me give you a fresh one to save you some time.
482,Single student,"Oh, okay."
485,New student,"All right, now I get it."
488,New student,"All right. So, we have to make one big, um-"
492,Teacher,Okay. So start over again.
495,Teacher,"Use the whole coordinate system, that way all the lines are nicely spaced out and everything."
498,New student,All right.
499,Teacher,Okay?
500,Single student,We're out of (inaudible).
502,Teacher,"Okay, well how do you want to graph it? Using an X Y table?"
506,Single student,Yeah.
507,Teacher,Or do you want to learn how to use slope and Y intercept?
510,Single student,X Y table.
512,Teacher,"Okay. So you're gonna make a X Y table. Do you agree, Ben? All right."
520,Teacher,"See, if you work with Chris side-by-side, then you can compare answers. Right?"
523,Single student,Mm hm.
524,Teacher,Don't just rely on Chris here.
526,Teacher,"All right now, Chris, the idea is I'm gonna plug in any values I really want for X and figure out my corresponding Y. Okay?"
534,Teacher,"But because this fraction is a two-thirds, what numbers should I possibly use that would make it easier for me?"
541,Single student,Three.
542,Teacher,"Numbers based on three. So like maybe negative three, zero, three, six. Or zero, three, six, would be good enough, right?"
549,Single student,Yeah.
550,Teacher,That way you can get that graph down. Okay?
557,Teacher,"So, you need my help, or do you want to try it on your own first?"
558,Single student,So... to input this X do I have to put this number?
561,Teacher,"All right, you ready?"
564,Teacher,"Well, if you want, we don't have to do the negative. You want to do the negative?"
571,Single student,Yeah.
571,Teacher,"Okay, here we go. Put a little negative three above there. Now you know I'm going to do two times negative three... is?"
580,Single student,Negative six.
581,Teacher,Divide by three is?
583,Single student,Neg- negative two.
584,Teacher,Good. Plus eight.
586,Single student,Six.
587,Teacher,Positive six.
589,Single student,Oh.
590,Teacher,"Right? Now you're going to put in a zero and do the same thing, right?"
600,Teacher,"All right? There you go. See, with zero you don't even have to bother putting it in. Right?"
604,Teacher,"You alr- you should already know that is your Y intercept. All right, try three. Now just make that a positive three."
611,Teacher,"That's it. You got it. You got it. Ben, see what Chris did there."
615,New student,All right.
616,Teacher,All right?
618,Teacher,"Okay. All right sir, it looks like you're being left out here, aren't you?"
625,New student,No.
626,Teacher,"Okay, you understand what they're doing?"
627,Single student,We're using slope.
630,Teacher,"Okay. So all right, let me- let me test you here. Let's try number four. All right?"
634,Single student,"Okay, number four."
636,Teacher,"Okay. Oh by the way guys, I like how you labeled them, like that."
639,New student,Thanks.
640,Teacher,"Excellent job. X minus nine, right?"
645,New student,"Minus nine, okay."
646,Teacher,So tell me how you would graph that?
649,Single student,I would-
651,Teacher,Here we go.
653,Single student,"I would go... negative nine. So, one, two, three, four, five."
659,Teacher,Now that's negative nine for X.
661,Single student,Uh huh.
662,Teacher,Right?
663,Single student,Mm hm.
664,Teacher,That negative nine really is my Y intercept.
668,Single student,So then... I go down.
669,Teacher,Ah ha.
670,Single student,"One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10."
674,Teacher,"Good. Now we only want to go nine. Here you go. Hey, you guys taught him pretty well then, huh?"
681,Single student,(inaudible)
682,Teacher,And now my slope is one-fourth.
684,Single student,Uh huh.
685,Teacher,So that means?
687,Single student,"One- one, two, three, four."
692,Teacher,Good job. Excellent job.
696,New student,Oh...
697,Teacher,All right.
698,New student,(inaudible) times two is six. Negative six.
701,New student,"All right this is seven, 10, 13, and 16 this time."
703,Teacher,Okay.
704,New student,Is this right?
705,Teacher,"What's your question, Brandon?"
706,New student,I don't even know how to do this.
709,Single student,I don't get it.
710,Teacher,What about your partner here? She's doing an excellent job here.
713,Single student,Oh.
714,Teacher,"What, are you shy or something?"
715,Single student,"No, I just asked this guy and he said-"
717,New student,I'm trying to do it too. I'm trying to figure this one out.
719,New student,"Yeah, how do you do this?"
721,Teacher,"Okay, let me go to this other group, guys. Brandon. Brandon. Do me a favor, all right?"
730,Teacher,"I'll give you a choice, all right? You can pick either Ashley or Nick. Either way, I want- I want them to teach it to you. All right?"
740,Teacher,"It's called teamwork here. Okay? All right. And if they can't do it, I'll be back in a few minutes to help you. All right?"
747,New student,"Mr. Ormsby, this is like the same thing as I did that one, right? That."
750,Teacher,Okay. Let's take a look here.
751,New student,"I mean, I know how to do this, but I don't know how to do the fractions."
755,Teacher,"I mean, a lot of these tables look great, now let's get them plotted here."
758,Single student,Okay.
759,Teacher,And we can see what it comes out to be.
761,New student,"So after we write them all down, we plot them on here?"
761,Teacher,Right.
762,Single student,Every single one?
763,Teacher,Right. And then you're going to label them. Now if you-
766,Teacher,"If you don't mind, since this is equation one, just put a little one at the end of it. And equation two put a two at it- at the end of it. Okay?"
773,Single student,All right.
774,Teacher,"Brandon, you had a comment? Question?"
776,New student,I know how to do the regular ones. I don't know how to do the one with fractions. That's confusing.
780,New student,Those are the ones that I have trouble with.
781,New student,Was he- Were you listening when Mr. Ormsby was saying this?
782,Teacher,"Well, okay."
786,Teacher,Well maybe you ought to go to Nick. Sounds like Nick knows what he's doing.
789,Single student,"No, I said that I have trouble on it."
790,Teacher,"Okay, then maybe we ought to go to Ashley."
792,Single student,"Nah, I could (inaudible)."
794,Single student,So you want- put-
794,Teacher,Okay.
795,Teacher,Okay. What do we got going on here?
797,New student,We're done.
799,Teacher,Sir?
800,New student,"Well, we got done with all the (inaudible). We were going to call you but you were talking to them."
803,Teacher,Trying to embarrass me here or something?
804,Single student,Of course not.
805,Single student,You're really slow. For these ones here-
805,Teacher,Uh huh.
806,Teacher,"You're such a character, Nick."
808,Single student,"For these- for the fractions we did the slope and then we made a table, and we're done."
812,Teacher,"And everybody agr- here agrees, right?"
813,New student,Uh huh.
814,Teacher,"Okay. So let me just check them real quick. I like how you numbered them one, and so on."
821,Teacher,This one you didn't number. What number is that one?
823,New student,"Uh, I think that was five."
824,New student,That was five.
824,Teacher,"That was five. That one's correct, so put a five there. Okay, I can safely assume that this one must be the four, right?"
833,Single student,Uh-
834,Teacher,Or is this one the four? Which one's the four?
836,Single student,This one's two.
838,Teacher,Which one's two?
839,New student,Four is this.
840,Single student,"Four- four is negative nine, and up one is four."
841,New student,This one.
842,New student,"So that- yeah, this is four."
844,Teacher,Are you sure about that?
845,Single student,Yeah.
846,Teacher,Because this one-
847,Single student,"One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, and nine. Oh no. This is four."
851,Teacher,Ah. Right.
853,Single student,This one's two.
854,Teacher,"So let- do me a favor. Erase the two, right, and label them right near the ends of the lines. How's that?"
863,Teacher,"'Cause right there I can't tell which line you're talking about, right?"
866,Single student,Right.
867,Teacher,"There I know. Hey two, that's that line. So this is the four line. Put the four right there. Okay? So both of those look excellent."
875,New student,Six minus (inaudible).
876,Teacher,"Slope of three-fifths and number four, slope of one-fourth. That's good."
881,Teacher,"Number one, slope with two-thirds starting at eight and this one is seven, right?"
887,New student,Mm hm.
888,Teacher,"Uh oh. I don't like equation three because look, it's going down. That's a positive three X."
898,Single student,Oh.
899,Teacher,It should be going-
900,Single student,Up.
901,Teacher,"It should be angling up. So correct number three, and then you guys- As soon as you get that corrected just move on."
905,Teacher,I'll check that one later. Okay?
908,New student,Mr. Ormsby?
912,Teacher,Here we go. Yeah?
913,Single student,We don't get number five.
915,Teacher,"Number five. All right, first of all, you know the Y intercept is what?"
919,Single student,Negative five.
920,Teacher,All right. So put a dot on negative five.
923,Single student,"One, two, three, four, five."
926,Teacher,Good. We all agree on that?
928,Two or more students,Yes.
929,Teacher,"Now, this is something so simple but very important."
931,Teacher,"See in Algebra we get lazy sometimes, right? Guess what number is in front of that X."
937,New student,One.
938,New student,A one.
939,Teacher,"A one, right Robert? So therefore put a one there. If the slope is one, what am I going to do?"
951,Teacher,"All right, you ready Sir? Make that one a- a fraction. How do I make one a fraction?"
956,Single student,One over one.
957,Teacher,"One over one. Write it- write like- let's just put it underneath there. One over one. Something to look at. All right, that's fine."
963,Teacher,"Now remember slope is rise over run, right?"
965,Single student,Mm hm.
966,Teacher,So one over one means I rise one and I go across one.
971,Single student,There.
972,Teacher,That's it. That's the slope of one. All right?
977,Teacher,Just let me check them real quick.
982,Teacher,"All right. Now do me a favor, guys. You labeled these really nice. As a matter of fact, this is a way- an ideal way of labeling it."
989,Teacher,"Write the whole equation, but like for example, equation one right here, put a one next to it also."
996,Teacher,"And this one's equation three, right? So put a three next to that."
998,Single student,Okay.
999,Teacher,"So number them, in other words, okay?"
1001,Single student,Okay.
1001,Teacher,"Because what that's going to do, that's going to help you when I ask these questions about each of the equations. Okay?"
1009,Teacher,Because that's how I label them. I label them by numbers. Does that make sense? All right.
1015,Teacher,"So as soon as you get that done, which you're almost done, you get them numbered, just move on to the next set of five."
1021,Single student,Okay.
1022,Teacher,All right?
1023,Single student,Yeah.
1025,Teacher,All right.
1028,New student,"So Y is three-fifths, X negative 10?"
1033,Teacher,"Okay. So wait a minute. You try- you're doing negative five, right?"
1036,Single student,Yeah.
1037,Teacher,Three times negative five is negative 15.
1038,Single student,Negative 15.
1040,Teacher,Divided by five. Negative three. Minus 10?
1044,Single student,"Is, um, negative, um, seven- Oh, minus 10?"
1048,Teacher,Negative three and a negative 10.
1050,Single student,"Oh, um, 13."
1051,Teacher,Negative 13. So let's change that.
1054,Single student,Mm hm.
1056,Teacher,"Well negative five is going to be, not five, but negative?"
1059,Single student,Thirteen.
1060,Teacher,"Thirteen. All right? Ben, you look like you're not- you're just coasting here, man. What's going on?"
1067,New student,(inaudible)
1072,Teacher,"Chris, make sure you help Ben out here, man. Ben- I just sense Ben's getting a little lost here."
1078,Teacher,"All right, this is your chance to ask not only Chris, but also Raymond here. Get some help from them."
1086,Single student,Okay.
1088,Teacher,You think you got it? Now zero of course is going to be what? If I put in zero here what am I going to get?
1094,Single student,Uh- Zero.
1097,Teacher,"Wait a minute, what's three-fifths times zero?"
1100,New student,Three-fifths times zero?
1101,Teacher,Zero. Minus 10 would be?
1103,Single student,Ten. No.
1105,Teacher,Zero minus 10 would be?
1108,Single student,Ten.
1109,Teacher,Not positive 10.
1110,Single student,Negative 10.
1111,Teacher,Negative 10. So you want to put a negative 10 there. Okay?
1114,Single student,"Okay. So, oh."
1117,Teacher,Now try at least one more of five. Okay?
1120,Single student,"Uh, Isn't that, uh-"
1123,Teacher,"Now it's a positive five, right?"
1124,Single student,Yeah.
1125,Teacher,"So it's going to be- Well, what's three times a positive five? Fifteen. Divided by five is?"
1131,Single student,Three.
1132,Teacher,Three minus 10.
1134,Single student,Seven.
1135,Teacher,Negative seven. Don't forget the negative.
1136,Single student,Negative seven.
1137,Single student,"Oh, all right."
1138,Teacher,Okay?
1140,Teacher,All right guys. Thanks for waiting so long.
1141,New student,Okay.
1142,Teacher,"All right, you want me to just check the answers?"
1143,New student,Yeah.
1144,Teacher,"Now the only favor I need you to do, is because for each of these numbered equations, just number them. For example, this is one, correct?"
1152,New student,Yeah.
1153,Teacher,This one was equation three.
1154,Single student,Yeah.
1155,Teacher,This one was equation five. So near the end of each of these arrows-
1158,Single student,"Yeah, put the number?"
1159,Teacher,Just put- put the number.
1161,Teacher,"And then this one, let me just make sure, because I don't have them all memorized."
1166,Teacher,"Let's see, negative nine was one-fourth. You've got the slope perfect there and this one was three-fifths, right?"
1172,Teacher,So everything looks perfect. Just number them and move on to the next five.
1176,Two or more students,Okay.
1177,Teacher,Okay?
1178,New student,Mr. Ormsby?
1181,Single student,We're on number six.
1182,New student,"I got it, guys. I got it."
1183,New student,Check our answers.
1184,New student,So here's all of number five.
1185,Teacher,"Look at that excellent work, man. Excellent work."
1187,New student,I crossed it out.
1188,New student,"There's one, there's two, there's three, and there's four and there's five."
1191,New student,I figured it out.
1192,Teacher,Excellent.
1193,New student,But it- they're having problems on number-
1195,New student,Oh there it is. I found it. I found it. I- I- now I (inaudible) do.
1198,Teacher,Okay. You know what? As a matter of fact I think it's time for me to address the whole class.
1202,New student,Okay.
1203,Teacher,"Everybody. Ladies and gentlemen, listen up. Five, four, three, two, one, zero."
1210,Teacher,"Now, about half of you are about ready to start the next set of five, right? Starting on number six?"
1216,New student,"Yep, that's what we're doing. We're starting (inaudible)."
1218,Teacher,"Let me give you a hint. Just a little reminder, what you will notice-"
1224,Teacher,"Julie, you're doing a great job but please listen, okay?"
1226,Teacher,You'll notice on equations six through 10 the slopes are negative. All right?
1232,New student,"Yep, all (inaudible)."
1233,Teacher,"So therefore, instead of rise over run meaning you'd go up and to the right, with the negative you're going to instead go, down and to the right."
1244,Teacher,Okay? Does that make sense to everybody?
1247,New student,Yeah.
1248,Teacher,So please keep going. Please make sure I check your first five and give you the okay to move on. Okay?
1252,New student,Could you check ours?
1253,New student,All right.
1254,Teacher,Yeah.
1255,Single student,"Actually, I'm on four."
1256,Teacher,"I'll check yours real quick. Okay. All right, good. You guys numbered them?"
1260,New student,Yeah.
1261,New student,Yeah.
1262,Teacher,"Okay. There's one, slope. Equation three, two-thirds. Equation five looks good."
1270,New student,I haven't even gotten to five. I'm already-
1271,Teacher,Okay. Then you've got four and two. It looks perfect so far.
1276,New student,Okay.
1277,Teacher,Move on to equation six then.
1278,Single student,Okay.
1279,Teacher,Now you're saying you're being left behind here a little bit? On which one?
1283,New student,"Well, they're obviously on five and-"
1287,Teacher,Okay.
1288,Single student,We're on-
1289,Teacher,"Now Robert, here, I'm sure can help you. You've got the- one of the smartest kids in class right here."
1293,Single student,"He's tried to explain it once, but I'm not so sure."
1296,Teacher,"Okay. It looks like you made a nice table here, though. You understand what you did there?"
1300,Single student,Yeah.
1301,Teacher,"Okay. So you- when you put in zero, one-fourth times zero is what?"
1305,Single student,Zero.
1306,Teacher,Minus nine is?
1307,Single student,Negative nine.
1308,Teacher,"Okay. Then you tried four, right?"
1311,Single student,Yeah.
1312,Teacher,All right. Why did you pick four and eight? Why didn't you pick like one and two and three? Numbers like that?
1317,Single student,Because they're divisible by four.
1320,Teacher,"Well said. Good job. So when I try four, see, what's one-fourth times four? Just one-"
1326,Single student,Yeah.
1327,Teacher,Minus nine is a negative eight.
1329,Single student,Yeah.
1330,Teacher,And then you put an eight. One-fourth of eight is?
1332,Single student,Two.
1333,Teacher,Minus nine is negative seven. So that's perfect. If you plot those three points you get exactly what is on your graph there. Okay?
1340,New student,Can I see this really quick?
1342,New student,Mr. Ormsby?
1343,Teacher,All right. Guys-
1345,New student,Are you sure this is right? Because you're all-
1347,Teacher,"Oh, so you want me to just check six real quick, right?"
1349,New student,And five.
1350,New student,And five.
1351,New student,"Five, because that's the one we messed up on (inaudible)."
1353,Teacher,Right. Five now looks perfect.
1355,Single student,No three. Three was-
1356,Teacher,"Oh, three was the one we messed up on. So three is right here and the idea is that you want a positive three slope, which you did perfectly."
1364,Single student,All right.
1365,Teacher,So three is good. Let's go back to six since we're here.
1370,Teacher,"Here's six, so you started at positive eight."
1372,Single student,Yeah.
1373,Teacher,"The slope is negative five-thirds so you went down five and over three, didn't you?"
1378,Single student,Yeah.
1379,Teacher,Perfect.
1380,Single student,All right.
1381,Teacher,Okay?
1384,Teacher,"Okay. Ashley, how is Brandon doing here?"
1387,New student,I'm helping him.
1388,Teacher,Brandon? Good. That's what I want to see.
1390,New student,The rest- we're done. We just want you to check.
1393,Teacher,"All right, you keep helping Brandon. Let me meet with Ashley over here. Nick, if you want to watch you can."
1397,New student,Okey-dokey.
1399,Teacher,"But I can tell you right now, five is good."
1401,Single student,Okay. And you see the pattern in eight and 10? If I put- how many do you add for 10?
1402,Teacher,Okay? Let me start in order here. One looks good. Hold it. Wait a minute. Let me check one again.
1409,Single student,"Yeah, you've got to do 12."
1410,Teacher,"One, the slope is two-thirds, isn't it? Right? So first of all our Y intercept is eight."
1414,Single student,Wait- wait.
1417,Teacher,"Ashley, let's look at yours since you're more comfortable with yours."
1419,New student,Yeah.
1420,Teacher,"You agree that zero, eight should be my first point, right?"
1423,Single student,Mm hm.
1424,Teacher,"Two, four, six, eight. Okay. That's good."
1427,Single student,Hold on Brandon.
1429,Teacher,Three-
1430,New student,"I made one over three. One, two, three."
1432,Teacher,"Oh, here's your mistake."
1434,New student,"Yep, Jessie."
1435,Teacher,"All right? Now watch Ashley, you ready? When I put in three, two times the three would be six-"
1443,Single student,Six. Oh yeah.
1444,Teacher,Divided by three would make?
1446,Single student,Two.
1449,Teacher,"Two. Six divided by three is two, right?"
1450,Single student,I know it's two.
1451,Teacher,"Okay, plus eight would make, 10. So three would be 10; well what's two plus eight? Ten."
1458,Teacher,"So if that's a 10, this one I'm sure has got to be something bigger. Okay?"
1463,New student,Eleven. Twelve?
1465,New student,This may be 12.
1466,Teacher,I believe it's 12.
1467,Single student,"Yeah, see I did it on here, but I did it wrong on my paper."
1469,Single student,It's weird.
1469,Teacher,Okay.
1470,Teacher,"All right, so it sounds like you guys didn't compare your answers here but I think that's your only mistake."
1479,Teacher,Because equation three looks very good. All right.
1483,Teacher,You know what? Equation two I don't necessarily like either. Is this supposed to be two?
1490,Teacher,Two says we're starting at what number?
1492,New student,Negative 10.
1493,Teacher,"Negative 10, right? You're not starting at negative 10 here. What's this number?"
1497,Teacher,"Two, four- somehow you're starting at negative six. So what happened on equation two, guys?"
1506,Teacher,"Hey, how come we didn't use your table?"
1508,New student,I don't know. We were looking at his.
1510,New student,"Okay. So if we start at 10, then-"
1513,Teacher,"Oh, I know- Look what you did wrong. You copied the equation down wrong."
1517,Single student,That's number four.
1519,Teacher,"Oh, I'm sorry. You're right. My mistake."
1522,Single student,"Oh yeah, it does start at six."
1524,Teacher,"I can't even read your writing. Yeah, why is that a six? That should be a negative 10, right?"
1527,Single student,It looks like a six but it's 10.
1528,Teacher,Okay. And five you got negative seven.
1530,Single student,Yeah.
1531,Teacher,I agree with that.
1532,Single student,Yeah.
1533,Teacher,"Okay, and then 10 you got negative four."
1537,Teacher,"Okay, so why don't you try re-plotting those three points and move on to equation six through 10 and I'll check on number two later on."
1547,Teacher,"Okay, the rest of them look pretty good, though. All right?"
1549,Single student,All right.
1550,New student,"Mr. Ormsby, whoo-hoo."
1552,Teacher,"Okay, what are we doing here, guys? Hey, how come none of these lines are labeled?"
1557,New student,Whoops.
1558,Teacher,Now what I suggest you do-
1559,Single student,(inaudible) two lines.
1560,Teacher,"Hold on. What I suggest you do before I come back is for each of these- just call it equation one, two, three, four, and five, right?"
1568,Teacher,Put a number at the end of each of these lines.
1573,Single student,"Oh, like number one, two, three-"
1574,Teacher,"Like for example, number one- Uh oh. Wait a minute. I don't like what I see here."
1583,Single student,Look what you made me do. You probably thought of it wrong.
1584,Teacher,"Okay. Let's see here. Number one, I believe this is supposed to be your number one here, right?"
1593,Single student,I think so.
1594,New student,I don't know.
1595,Teacher,"How come it's going down, guys?"
1596,New student,"I don't know, it does it."
1598,Teacher,Aren't all these slopes positive? So all of these should be going up.
1602,New student,How's it going down?
1604,Teacher,Look at it. It's going down.
1606,Single student,It's going up.
1607,Teacher,"How do you read a book? How do you read a book, sir?"
1608,Single student,Left to right.
1609,Teacher,You read from left to right. So let's start on the left side of the line.
1612,Single student,Yeah.
1613,Teacher,And as I move to the right I'm going in which direction?
1616,Single student,Down.
1617,Teacher,"Right. Now if you look at all the other lines, see they're all positive."
1620,Single student,But it's going up.
1622,Teacher,Sir you have to read from left to right. Okay? All right.
1627,New student,It's going down like that.
1628,Teacher,"So, guys, you need to make those corrections. Label the line. Correct this one, at least."
1632,Single student,How come we've never done this before?
1633,New student,You made me do it (inaudible).
1633,Teacher,Okay?
1634,New student,Could you check our answers for (inaudible).
1636,Teacher,"Oh my gosh. Let me make sure I keep track of the time, too. All right."
1642,Teacher,Hey you guys did an awesome job here. Okay. Let's take a look here. So here's your number six right?
1649,New student,Uh huh.
1651,Teacher,And you started at eight and the slope was negative five-thirds so you went down five and over three.
1657,Single student,Uh huh.
1659,Teacher,That line looks perfect. Let's look at your number seven. Here's negative one. You went down four and over one.
1667,Teacher,There's your line there. That looks perfect. Let's check number eight real quick.
1672,New student,"All right, I think I did it kinda-"
1674,Teacher,"Oh, that's the eight, right? Okay? So on number eight you started at 12 and negative one-third. Looks perfect."
1683,Teacher,"Number nine is 14, which is where?"
1686,New student,It's all the way up here.
1687,Teacher,"Way at the very top. And negative three-halves means you went down three and over two, so there's your line right there."
1696,Teacher,"And finally number 10, we're at three, the slope is negative one. Perfect."
1701,New student,Cool.
1702,Teacher,"So now, all you guys have to do-"
1705,New student,Answer the questions.
1706,Teacher,Is to answer these questions. Okay? The best you can.
1709,New student,On this piece of paper?
1711,Teacher,"On your piece of paper, okay?"
1712,Single student,Okay.
1712,Teacher,On your own piece of paper.
1713,Single student,Okay.
1716,Teacher,"All right, how we doing here, guys?"
1717,New student,I don't know (inaudible).
1720,Teacher,What's the ruler for?
1721,Single student,Oh.
1723,Teacher,Look at this. Just from now on make sure- straighten out these lines and keep going.
1729,Single student,All right.
1730,Single student,Yeah.
1730,Teacher,And are you labeling? That's number one-
1733,Single student,No that's number three. I forgot to do number two.
1733,Teacher,Number two.
1735,Teacher,"Okay, wait a minute. Number three is concerning me. You ready?"
1738,Single student,Yeah.
1739,Teacher,"Let's try this again real quick. All right. It's three X plus seven, right?"
1743,Single student,Yeah.
1744,Teacher,"So when I put in- Let's- let's just start with zero. When I put in zero, what's three times zero?"
1748,Single student,Zero.
1749,Teacher,Plus seven is?
1750,Single student,Seven.
1751,Teacher,Why did you put negative seven? What's zero plus seven?
1755,Single student,Well I started- Oh.
1757,Teacher,"Chris, let me take a look at your table for three."
1760,Teacher,"How come you're not standing up to Raymond here and saying, hey man, look I got the right answers."
1767,Teacher,"All right, your table is correct. You've got to believe in yourself. All right?"
1768,New student,I didn't know it was right.
1770,Teacher,You guys gotta start working better together and comparing answers. All right?
1776,Teacher,"Ben, I'm worried about you man. What are we doing here."
1778,Teacher,Put away the book.
1779,New student,Okay.
1780,Teacher,"And Chris, you need to work with your normal partner here a little bit better. And compare answers."
1787,Teacher,"So I mean, if you would have compared answers, guys, you would have seen on this table here, right-"
1794,Teacher,"That, hey! Someone must be making a mistake because we're getting different answers here, right?"
1797,New student,Mm hm.
1799,Teacher,"So, either correct yours, or if you want, you can trust Chris. I would trust Chris- Chris' to be honest."
1806,Single student,All right.
1807,Teacher,Okay.
1808,New student,I used twos... (inaudible) threes.
1810,Teacher,Right. Now did you have to go by twos?
1812,Single student,I- I don't- did I?
1815,Teacher,Well wait a minute. Isn't this just a regular number three?
1818,New student,Yeah.
1819,New student,Yeah.
1820,Teacher,"So on these kind, I always told you just use, like, zero, one and two, right?"
1823,Teacher,You didn't have to go by multiples or anything because there's no fraction to divide by. You see?
1829,Teacher,"All right guys, let's see what we can do here."
1831,New student,"Mr. Ormsby? All right, never mind."
1835,Teacher,Okay. Can I interrupt the whole class? Shh.
1840,Teacher,Okay.
1841,New student,I guess.
1842,Teacher,"Five, four, three, two, one, zero. Shh. Now please listen. Okay?"
1847,Teacher,The thing is I- I have to be honest.
1851,Teacher,"I'm getting a little- a little worried, maybe a little frustrated here, just because I could see that some of you have some serious weaknesses."
1859,Teacher,"Yet, you have people either across from you or right next to you, your own partner that seems most of the time,"
1868,Teacher,"have the right answers, yet you're not even asking them."
1872,Teacher,"So, guys, I ask you, starting right now, is check your work with your partner's work. Work together."
1879,Teacher,"All right, this is not an individual kind of assignment here. Does everything I say make sense so far?"
1885,New student,Yes Mr. Ormsby.
1886,Teacher,Okay. Now let me just give you a heads up. We've got roughly what? Twelve minutes left in class?
1894,New student,"Um, (inaudible)."
1894,Teacher,Okay. I want you to keep doing what you're doing. If for whatever reason you actually get to the last page-
1901,New student,"Yeah, we are at there."
1902,Teacher,"And you- you've answered these questions to the best of your ability- Now obviously today we have no time to discuss it, okay."
1908,Teacher,"We're going to pick up- we're going to pick this up again on Monday, but if you happen to ask these questions-"
1913,New student,Monday?
1916,Teacher,"Yeah, we're back on Monday, right?"
1918,New student,Yeah.
1919,Teacher,"When we- when we- after you answer these questions, if you get that far, please make sure you do this ""quickwrite""."
1928,Teacher,All right. Which simply means all I want you to do is be honest with yourself and with me and just sit there for the remaining time.
1935,Teacher,"Write a minimum of two paragraphs, okay, on what we've learned today. What you've actually learned today. Okay?"
1945,Teacher,"Those of you that aren't at this stage, don't worry about it yet."
1948,Teacher,"At about, let's say, four or five minutes, I'm going to make all of you do it anyways."
1952,New student,"You're so generous, Mr. Ormsby."
1953,Teacher,So please keep working wherever you are. I'm still walking around.
1958,Teacher,Yeah?
1959,New student,(inaudible)
1961,Teacher,Don't worry about that until Monday. We'll catch up on Monday. All right. Let's focus on this.
1963,New student,We got done and we (inaudible) like- where's the paper at?
1967,New student,Right there.
1968,Teacher,"All right, Ashley?"
1970,New student,"Yeah, um- Okay, I don't get these two."
1975,Teacher,All right. Does anyone in this group-
1977,Two or more students,No.
1978,Teacher,Understand what to do here?
1979,New student,"No. Because, like, there's different numbers. Which one would we use?"
1981,Teacher,Okay. All right. Okay. Now you want to use slope and Y intercept or do you want to make tables?
1988,Single student,Tables.
1989,Teacher,"Seems like tables are the way to go here, right?"
1991,Single student,Yeah.
1991,Teacher,"So let's- let's go there, all right? First of all, Ashley, that's a negative five-thirds, isn't it?"
1997,New student,Oh.
1998,New student,Wait- No- the fastest-
1999,Teacher,"Okay. So now, if I plug in zero, guys- Brandon, watch. If I plug in zero, what's negative five-thirds times zero?"
2008,Single student,Zero.
2009,Teacher,Plus eight is?
2010,Single student,Eight.
2011,Teacher,All right. That was easy.
2013,Single student,But I don't know what to use. Like threes?
2015,Teacher,You would use threes. Try three and six. Okay?
2020,New student,My stomach's hurting. Can I get a drink of water?
2023,Teacher,"Sir, no. You have to stay here. All right? So- all right, let's try three. Nick, Jessie, you ready?"
2029,New student,Two- 10.
2030,Teacher,"If I put in a three there, okay-"
2034,Single student,"It's going to be five, right?"
2035,Teacher,You're going to get negative five because the negative plus eight. What's negative five plus eight?
2040,Single student,Negative- Oh yeah.
2042,Teacher,Positive three.
2043,Single student,"Wait, (inaudible) is negative two."
2044,New student,"Wait, is that how you do three?"
2045,Teacher,Well you wrote it upside down. That's okay. And then the next one is going to be what?
2049,New student,Negative two.
2050,Teacher,It's going to be negative two. You got it.
2052,Single student,Oh.
2053,Teacher,(inaudible) two.
2055,Single student,Oh no. I (inaudible).
2056,Teacher,"Okay, you haven't done- You did that in your head, huh?"
2057,Single student,Yeah.
2057,Teacher,Impressive.
2058,Single student,I always do my work in my head.
2059,Teacher,Okay. So don't let the negatives scare you. Just the same idea as the front.
2064,Teacher,"Just know that when you times, you've got to have a negative, right, in your problem. That's all."
2071,Single student,All right.
2073,Teacher,"Why do you keep getting out of your seat, Robert?"
2074,New student,"Well, I have to (inaudible)."
2075,Teacher,I'm coming to-
2076,Teacher,"Okay, I just kind of noticed out of the corner of my eye. So what's going on here, how we doing?"
2080,New student,Okay. We're doing fine.
2084,Teacher,Okay? So have I come by to check all 10 equations yet?
2089,Single student,"No not yet, we're just- We're on number 10."
2090,New student,Not all 10. Just the first five.
2091,New student,We're on number 10.
2092,Teacher,Okay. You are on number 10. You want me to wait until you get number 10 done?
2095,New student,Yeah.
2096,New student,Yeah.
2097,Teacher,Okay. All right.
2099,New student,"Why did I get it wrong- oh, I didn't write it."
2100,Teacher,"Ladies, you've been awful quiet over here. What's going on?"
2103,New student,"Well, because we've been waiting for you?"
2104,Teacher,"Okay, all right."
2105,New student,For like a century.
2107,Teacher,"So where are you stuck? Or if you're not stuck, what would like me- Do you want me to just check your answers then?"
2112,New student,Yeah.
2113,Teacher,Is that what you're saying?
2114,Single student,Yeah.
2115,Teacher,Okay. So- So I've already checked the first five? Yes or no?
2121,New student,No.
2122,New student,No.
2123,Teacher,"Oh, really?"
2124,Single student,"Well, because you've been over there, you know-"
2126,Teacher,"Yeah, I know. I've been pretty busy. All right, let's start with six through 10."
2129,New student,"Well, we're only on eight."
2130,Teacher,"So- Okay, so I'll do- I'll do the first eight, how's that?"
2133,Single student,First eight- Okay.
2136,Teacher,"All right. So I agree, that's plus 12. Wait a minute, which one are we doing? Number six."
2141,Teacher,"That's plus eight, right? Two, four, six, eight. Good."
2144,Teacher,"Now negative five-thirds would mean you come down five and you go over three, right? So that one's perfect."
2150,Teacher,Number seven. You would have started at negative one and because of the negative four slope you would have gone down four and over one.
2153,New student,Number three.
2158,Teacher,So that one is perfect.
2160,Single student,And number three?
2161,Teacher,"Okay. And number eight, I'm a little concerned. See how it's slanting up? See, eight's a negative one-third."
2168,New student,"Yeah, but that's a plus 12."
2169,Teacher,So are you ready? Well what does plus 12 mean? Up here. So erase number eight. Try number eight again. Okay?
2180,Single student,(inaudible)
2182,Teacher,"Okay. All right, wait a minute Jessica- All right, let me slow down, then. Because trust me, I'm sick and I'm also tired but we-"
2188,Teacher,"We can do this, all right. You ready?"
2191,New student,"Zero, three, and six is right, though, right?"
2193,Teacher,"Zero was 12. So why did you plot down here, when zero positive 12 is up there."
2198,Single student,"Oh, I made a mistake."
2202,Teacher,"Okay, let's look at the rest of your table."
2204,Single student,I put a negative.
2206,Teacher,"So three. All right, if I put a three here, DeCarlos, what's one-third of three?"
2212,New student,"Um, one."
2214,Teacher,"One, right? So that negative makes it a negative one plus 12, which was a positive- So you had these points exactly right."
2219,New student,I check- I put them backwards.
2220,Teacher,"So you put them down- you plotted wrong, basically, right?"
2223,Single student,Yeah.
2223,Teacher,All right.
2225,New student,Mr. Ormsby?
2227,Teacher,"Okay, all right. Yes? You're finally done, right?"
2230,New student,Yes.
2231,Teacher,Okay. If you don't mind I'll just take a quick glance. Spot-check a few of them because I'd like you to move on to the questions.
2239,New student,Okay.
2240,New student,All right.
2241,Teacher,Start answering the questions. Okay?
2242,Teacher,"And the ones I'm looking at right now, like for example, this one here this is number seven. That looks good."
2247,Teacher,"Number six, five over three, that looks perfect. Okay. Oh, let me see. You just finished 10, right?"
2255,New student,Mm hm.
2255,Teacher,And that one's also perfect. So I can safely say that you guys seem to know what you're doing. So now please answer these questions. All right?
2264,New student,That's a lot of questions.
2265,Teacher,"For example- Well, just go one by one. You're going to have more time on Monday anyway."
2268,Single student,All right.
2269,Teacher,"But on number one, what- what did you notice about the first five equations? When you graphed them what did you honestly notice about them all?"
2276,New student,They all had a slope.
2277,New student,They all went to the right.
2279,Teacher,They all went up and to the right.
2280,New student,Yeah.
2281,Teacher,They had a-
2282,Teacher,"That's why we always said they had a positive slope because the positive number in front of X, all right? Okay."
2283,New student,"Yeah, they were positive."
2289,Teacher,"All right, ladies and gentlemen. Shh. Listen up."
2294,Teacher,"Wherever you are- wherever you are, honestly guys, it really doesn't matter."
2300,Teacher,I really appreciate the effort you put in for me today. That's the important thing.
2304,Teacher,What I'd like you to do-
2308,Teacher,"What I'd like you to do now, whether you're done or not guys, I honestly hope that all of you have learned something today. Okay?"
2316,Teacher,"So I want everyone now, on their own piece of paper- I repeat, on your own piece of paper-"
2323,Teacher,Do this quickwrite for the remaining part of the class.
2327,New student,On that same piece of paper.
2328,Teacher,"And a few hints would be like, hey did you learn- did you understand?"
2332,Teacher,Did you understand something about slope maybe a little bit better?
2334,New student,Same paper?
2336,Teacher,Or Y intercepts.
2337,Single student,Same paper.
2338,Teacher,"Or maybe you got better at making tables. On the same piece of paper, yes sir. Any questions on that?"
2345,Teacher,"All right, quickwrite time guys. Let's get that done."
2350,New student,Can you check these?
2351,Teacher,What's this skull and bones stuff?
2353,New student,Don't know.
2354,New student,Nice drawing.
2355,Teacher,"Jeremy? Oh, you're waiting for me because we're done over here?"
2358,Single student,Yeah.
2359,New student,Yeah.
2360,Teacher,Let me- let me see wh- Let me see the answers.
2363,Single student,They're over here.
2364,New student,(inaudible)
2366,Teacher,"Okay. But where's your own work, Dell?"
2371,Single student,(inaudible)
2372,New student,I didn't know it was-
2373,Teacher,And right now what are you supposed to be doing?
2374,Single student,I was doing that. He was doing this.
2375,Teacher,"I understand, but right now what are you supposed to be doing?"
2377,New student,We were waiting for you.
2379,Teacher,"All right. Now that I'm here, what else could you be doing right now? What did I talk about on the board there?"
2383,Single student,This. Quickwrite.
2384,New student,The quickwrite.
2386,Teacher,"All right. See, I can see quickly you haven't even finished graphing these yet, so I want you to do the quickwrite right now."
2392,Teacher,And then I expect better results on Monday. I want you to finish this up on Monday. Fair enough? Okay Jeremy?
2400,New student,"Mr. Ormsby? Number six, it says, what do you notice about the intersection between-"
2405,Teacher,"Ah, see now it gets a little interesting. Show me your equation two."
2409,Single student,"Two is uh, down here."
2411,Teacher,"Show me your equation six. Now, one thing that hopefully you understand is- See a line-"
2418,Teacher,"Those arrows mean they go on- lines go on forever in both directions, right."
2421,Single student,Oh yeah.
2422,Teacher,So take your ruler... and let's ext- actually extend this line. Be very careful. Be precise.
2429,Teacher,Let's extend that line straight down. Okay. Go all the way down to there somewhere. There you go.
2440,Teacher,"Good. Good. Good. Good. Now, that's good enough because the idea is, I'm asking about what? The intersection."
2449,Teacher,An intersection is where two lines-
2451,Single student,Meet.
2452,New student,Meet.
2453,Teacher,"Meet or cross each other, right? Look where these two lines meet or cross. What do you notice about the angles there?"
2460,New student,It's a right angle.
2462,Teacher,"Well said. Right? So now in mathematics, this is something I haven't mentioned yet, that's also called perpendicular."
2470,Teacher,Have you guys heard about that before?
2471,Single student,Yeah.
2472,Teacher,"So these two lines, therefore you would say are? Perpendicular. They make right angles. Right?"
2479,Single student,Mm hm.
2481,New student,My pencil.
2485,New student,Hi Mr. Ormsby.
2486,New student,I screwed up on graph nine and-
2487,Teacher,Okay.
2489,New student,He's all-
2494,Teacher,Have you started your quickwrite yet Brittany?
2496,New student,"No, because I was doing the graphing and Nathan has all the answers, so I have to write down all the answers."
2501,Teacher,Right now I want you to stop what you're doing and let's just say one paragraph now. Just write as much as you can.
2509,Single student,I didn't learn anything.
2510,Teacher,All right.
2512,Teacher,You didn't learn- you didn't know how- learn how to make tables or understand slope or Y intercept or anything like that? Okay?
2534,New student,"I said (inaudible) graph, I'm not gonna do it because I got messed up on the, um-"
2536,New student,It looks nice. That looks nice.
2538,New student,On the-
2539,Teacher,How come you crumpled it up?
2540,New student,Because I messed up.
2541,Teacher,"Oh, so you got a new one?"
2542,Single student,Yeah.
2543,Teacher,So on Monday you're going to redo it.
2544,Single student,I'm- I'm just trying to-
2545,Teacher,Maybe even use a ruler to draw your coordinate system. Make it look professional.
2549,New student,Yeah.
2550,New student,Do it all the way down.
2551,New student,Over on your weekend.
2552,Teacher,Okay.
2555,New student,I'm not going to be here.
2556,Teacher,Okay.
2557,New student,"We're getting our work done here, look."
2560,Teacher,"Last time ladies and gentlemen. Five, four, three, two, one, zero."
2567,Teacher,Okay. Here's the deal.
2570,Teacher,"Because we're running short on time and since I'm going to follow up anyways on Monday, okay-"
2578,Teacher,"And we're actually going to have a little discussion about not just graphing but also what I wanted you to discover about these lines, all right."
2587,Teacher,Please make sure you put away all your work. Do not lose any of it.
2593,New student,Where are we-
2593,Teacher,Do not turn in anything today because you're going to need it all Monday.
2595,Single student,What do we do- What do we do with this?
2598,Teacher,Can I trust you- can your group trust you to fold that up and put it away somewhere?
2601,New student,Nope.
2602,New student,(inaudible) in your backpack.
2603,Teacher,All right.
2604,New student,What do we do with these?
2606,Teacher,Keep it until Monday. Okay?
2608,New student,"Keep it till Monday in your backpack because if I take it, I'm going to lose it."
2612,Teacher,Okay.
2613,New student,"Mr. Ormsby, I'm not going to be here all next weekend."
2617,Single student,"Or all next week, 'cause we're going up to Seattle for um, Thanksgiving."
2621,Teacher,Okay.
2622,Single student,And I'm gonna be (inaudible)-
2623,Teacher,"You're le- You're not even going to be here Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday?"
2625,Single student,"No, 'cause (inaudible)."
2626,New student,D-O-G.
2627,New student,D- Cat. C-A-T.
2630,Teacher,Okay.
2631,New student,"I will- I'll be back um, on the-"
2633,Teacher,Leave your work with another group member then.
2634,New student,"Hey, what do we do with this, Mr. Ormsby?"
2636,Teacher,"Leave that on the desk. That will be fine. Okay, hurry up and go guys. Have a good weekend."
2641,New student,You too.
2642,New student,"Wait, Mr. Ormsby. I'm taking off."
2647,New student,That was fun.
2648,Teacher,Did you have fun? Good.
2649,New student,No.
2651,New student,I had a blast.
2652,New student,But I actually learned something without goofing off.
