time,speaker,talk
3,Teacher,"All right, let me show you something from yesterday."
17,Teacher,"Given enough time, and enough... depth, what's gonna happen to the sediments?"
28,Teacher,"What's gonna happen, there Yolanda?"
30,Single student,It's gonna become cemented.
33,Teacher,That's good.
38,Teacher,"Now if- how are you gonna spot, how are you gonna identify sedimentary rock when you see it?"
49,Teacher,What's (it have)?
54,Single student,You have deposition.
56,Teacher,"Well, you're telling us certainly how it's made."
60,Single student,Yeah.
61,Teacher,"And, you know, that's certainly a good thing, all right? But I- I just want to come back to this."
69,New student,Yeah.
70,Teacher,"You know, we know how it's made."
73,Teacher,"Sediments get deposited, buried and cemented together, as Yolanda tells us, and it forms sedimentary rock."
83,Teacher,"But my question is, how are you gonna spot it, how are you gonna identify it when you see it?"
91,Teacher,"There's a lot of roads that are cut from sedimentary rock, and you can see it if you know what to look for."
100,Teacher,"What's that, Samuel?"
102,New student,When it- certain rocks might have layers on it.
105,Teacher,Oh.
113,Teacher,Let's see.
117,Teacher,Like that?
118,New student,Yeah.
119,New student,Yeah.
120,Teacher,"Now, how do you know that's sedimentary rock?"
121,New student,Because it's-
122,Teacher,"How do you know? How do you know? How do you know, Nikita? Look at it."
129,Single student,Because it's stuck together.
131,Teacher,How do you know it's stuck together?
133,New student,Because it's in layers.
135,Teacher,Say that.
136,Single student,Because it's in layers.
137,Teacher,Okay. That's what- who said that?
139,New student,Me.
140,Teacher,That's what Samuel said. Absolutely. Absolutely.
145,Teacher,"So, you know, just in a cross-section, looking at it from the side, it appears like that."
154,Teacher,"All right. Now, how do you- why do you suppose you can see the layers here? Because if this river wasn't here, you wouldn't see the layers."
162,Teacher,"What did the river do to the rock? At least the sedimentary rock? What's happening here, Corey?"
168,New student,(inaudible) make stratas.
170,Teacher,"That's good. You know, the word- that's a good word. Another word for layers are strata."
178,Teacher,"Okay, but what did the river do to the sedimentary rock?"
185,Teacher,"We did this. What is that, Eric?"
188,New student,It cuts into it.
189,Teacher,"That's right. So here's a wonderful example of a river- it's the Colorado River- cutting a canyon,"
197,Teacher,"and in canyons, if the river is cutting through sedimentary rock, you could see the layer. Now, let me ask you this."
205,Teacher,Suppose- and this was our little model from yesterday- suppose when the sediments got deposited in- in some ancient sea.
219,Teacher,Sorry.
221,Teacher,"Suppose- suppose an animal, the remains of an animal, got deposited in the river along with the sediments."
232,Teacher,"So now we have an animal, you know, that could have been buried... a million years ago, 10 million years ago, 50 million years ago."
245,Teacher,What do you think's gonna happen to that animal?
252,Teacher,"Rudy, what do you think?"
253,New student,"It's gonna blend into the rocks, with the rest of the sediments."
258,Teacher,"That's right. Now, there's a word for that. There's a word for that."
266,Teacher,"What's that, Sonia?"
268,New student,Becomes fossilized.
269,Teacher,That's good. Very good.
278,Teacher,"I'd love to pass it around, but since it's sedimentary rock- you can see the layers here- I'm afraid that it's gonna fall down and crack."
286,Teacher,"So I'll just come around. How do you like that, Terrence?"
292,New student,Like it.
293,Teacher,Huh?
307,Teacher,"You did good yesterday, Antwone. All right. Now, let me ask you another question."
314,Teacher,"Suppose we dig down further into the sedimentary rock, into a layer that's underneath it."
323,Teacher,"Maybe- maybe this fossil of a fish is found in here, and maybe something like this-"
337,Teacher,is found below it.
339,New student,What is that?
340,Teacher,"Well, it's called a brachiopod. And to us it looks like a clam. It's a shelled animal. If you had this fossil and you found it over here,"
358,Teacher,which would you say is older?
361,New student,The one at the bottom.
363,Teacher,Which would you say is older?
365,New student,Um-
368,Teacher,"What would you say, Aisha- Angela?"
371,New student,I'd say the one (inaudible).
372,Teacher,This one is older?
373,Single student,"No, //the other one"
374,New student,//No. The bottom one.
375,Teacher,Why is the bottom older?
376,New student,Because it's more down.
378,Teacher,That's right.
381,Teacher,So I- so obviously the- the strata or the layers on the bottom are older than the ones on the top.
389,Teacher,"Now, you could use this."
390,Teacher,This is how geologists go about figuring out what animal came first and what animal came second and what animal came third.
400,Teacher,"So it's almost like looking back in a book, where the pages at the bottom contain fossils that are older than the pages on the top."
414,Teacher,"All right. Now, let me show you something. Let me shut this. Corey, you want to get the lights for a minute?"
426,Teacher,Don't laugh.
427,New student,Oh.
429,Teacher,"Sonia, I told you not to laugh. Oh."
434,New student,I love your pants. Loving it.
440,Teacher,All right. Any idea where I am?
443,New student,It's-
444,Teacher,Any idea?
447,New student,"Yeah, um-"
452,Teacher,"Well, I don't mean the exact- I can tell you the exact location, but the type of landscape I'm on."
459,New student,Ice.
460,Teacher,"No. It's not ice, Samuel."
462,New student,It's a-
465,Teacher,Sonia?
466,New student,Is it a mountain?
467,Teacher,It's a kind of mountain.
469,Single student,A cliff?
470,Teacher,I don't know if you can call it a cliff.
473,New student,It's a rock.
475,Teacher,I'm standing on rock.
484,Teacher,"Sonia, got a clue here?"
489,Teacher,Delia. I'm sorry.
492,New student,No.
495,Teacher,Yolanda?
496,New student,"Maybe you're standing on a rock, and the sediments in the middle are eroding."
502,Teacher,No. That's not how this hole got here. All right. Rudy?
511,New student,"A river went in the (inaudible), and it dried out."
515,Teacher,"Let me tell you where it was, all right? This is in an island-"
522,Two or more students,Hawaii.
525,Teacher,Does that help? The island of Hawaii.
527,New student,Oh.
528,Teacher,Hawaiian islands-
529,New student,I got it.
530,Teacher,"There's many islands. The biggest one is- is Hawaii. The one that has the- the capital, Oahu- or Honolulu is on the island of Oahu."
539,Teacher,But there's something about the Hawaiian islands.
543,New student,Me.
544,Teacher,What is that? What was that? //Jeffrey?
546,New student,//They're all volcanoes.
547,New student,They're volcanoes.
548,Teacher,That's right.
549,New student,You're on a volcano.
551,New student,Volcano?
552,Teacher,"So I'm standing on a vol- near the top of a volcano. Now, if I'm standing on the top of a volcano,"
564,Teacher,Why am I not standing on sedimentary rock?
573,Teacher,Why do I have to be standing on another kind of rock that we're gonna call non-sedimentary at least for the time being? Why? Paola?
583,New student,Because the lava was probably (running or so)-
585,Teacher,Can't hear.
586,Single student,"Because it was probably hot, the rock or the lava was running or something."
591,Teacher,"Well, you're getting close."
592,New student,"Moist, or-"
594,Teacher,"You're getting close. What is it? What do you say, Carl?"
599,New student,"Because of the (inaudible) going into the hole, it could probably break off."
605,Teacher,No.
607,Teacher,Wait a minute. We just got through saying not 10 minutes ago that if sediments get deposited in some sea and they get buried deep enough-
621,Teacher,they may be pressed into sedimentary rock.
626,Teacher,"Now, I'm not standing on sediments, and I'm not standing on sedimentary rock. What kind of rock am I standing on?"
636,New student,Mountain.
637,Teacher,"What is that- what do you say there, uh, Kyra- uh-"
643,New student,Kyra.
644,New student,Kyra.
645,Teacher,Kyra.
646,New student,You're standing on non-sedimentary rock.
647,Teacher,"Yeah, but how is it different than sedimentary rock? Think the way this rock- this rock forms."
658,Teacher,How did it form?
659,New student,"Because, um-"
660,Teacher,"How did it form, Terrence? How does it form, Samuel?"
664,New student,By heat.
665,New student,Heat.
670,Teacher,Heat is necessary. Sonia?
673,New student,Is it metamorphic rock?
677,New student,Magma.
678,Teacher,What comes out of a volcano?
681,Two or more students,Lava.
682,Teacher,"Okay. //Now,"
683,New student,//(inaudible) magma.
684,Teacher,we can call it lava if it comes to the surface.
688,Teacher,Some lava never comes to the surface. We can't call it lava; we have to call it magma.
695,Teacher,"Once you say magma, you include the magma that comes to the surface that we call lava,"
701,Teacher,"or magma that never makes it to the surface, stays underground. Now, look at your charts."
710,Teacher,"What has to happen to magma, or in other words, molten rock- that's where the heat comes in- in order for it to become solid? Think about it."
722,New student,It has to cool.
723,Teacher,"That's right. So if magma cools, it becomes solid, much the same way that when water cools it becomes ice."
735,Teacher,"And what kind of rock is this non-sedimentary rock? It doesn't come from sediments. What is it, Terrence?"
744,New student,It's igneous rock.
746,Teacher,"Very good. So there's another type of rock. Now, look at this. Let me lower the screen a minute."
759,Teacher,"So I- I went down the slope of the volcano, I walked about four or five miles, and I came to this sign."
782,Teacher,So I'm giving away my age. What does it say there?
790,New student,September 1974-
791,Teacher,"Sheba, what does it say? I know if you can see it, the rest of us can see it."
794,New student,September 1974 Lava Flow.
797,Teacher,Okay. What kind of rock do you think this is?
803,New student,Igneous.
804,Teacher,"What kind of rock, Antwone?"
806,New student,Magma.
807,Teacher,Huh?
808,Single student,Magma. Lava.
809,Teacher,"You're right. Lava is magma, but this long since cooled down. This isn't hot anymore. It became solidified. What kind of rock?"
821,New student,Igneous.
822,Teacher,"Okay. So let's put that one on the board. If you had to- if you had to describe how igneous rock is formed, how could you say it in one sentence?"
843,Teacher,One sentence.
850,Teacher,One sentence.
852,New student,Cold lava.
853,Teacher,"What would you say, Terrence? One sentence."
864,New student,I don't know.
867,Teacher,It's on the chart right in front of you.
882,Teacher,You see it?
883,New student,Yeah.
884,Teacher,All right. How does igneous rock form?
892,Teacher,"How does it form, Kyra?"
895,New student,Igneous rock is formed when magma cools.
897,Teacher,Can't hear.
898,Single student,"Igneous rock is formed when magma cools, (magma)."
909,Teacher,"Now, when magma cools, what happens to the state of matter that it's in? There's a change in state of matter?"
916,New student,Yeah.
917,Teacher,"Yeah. So what's the change, Rudy?"
918,Two or more students,Solid.
919,New student,From liquid to solid.
920,Teacher,Okay. So it becomes solid so we could say it solidifies.
929,Teacher,"There you go. All right. Now, look at this."
936,Teacher,What evidence is there that this is igneous rock? Look at- look at the surface. Look at the surface.
952,Teacher,Look at the surface.
960,Teacher,Touch it.
961,New student,How come you don't want to touch it?
962,Teacher,It's not hot anymore.
968,Teacher,"All right. Anyone see any evidence? Remember, it was once liquid."
976,New student,"Oh, oh, oh, I know."
977,Teacher,"What do you see there? What do you see, Terrence?"
981,New student,It's like- the little holes inside of it.
984,Teacher,"Well, you're right. What do you think the little holes are from?"
987,Two or more students,Bubbles. Bubbles.
989,Teacher,What kind of bubbles?
990,New student,Magma bubbles or lava bubbles.
992,New student,Oxygen.
993,Teacher,"Well, what makes bubbles?"
995,Two or more students,Heat.
996,New student,Air.
997,New student,Liquid.
998,New student,Air.
999,Teacher,Air. Some kind of gas.
1001,Teacher,"So when this magma came up through the volcano in Hawaii, the magma that it contained had a lot of gas in it."
1013,Teacher,"I guess it was something like club soda, has bubbles in it. So when the rock cooled and solidified-"
1019,New student,The holes-
1020,Teacher,"The holes- yeah. The holes became preserved. All right? Now, take a look at your chart. I want to show you something."
1029,Teacher,Right under the rock cycle chart is a scheme for igneous rock identification.
1040,Teacher,"Now, you see where it says vesicular?"
1043,New student,Mm-hm.
1044,Teacher,You see? Look where I'm pointing.
1045,New student,Yeah.
1046,Teacher,"Vesicular means gas bubbles. So what I'm holding is vesicular basalt, all right? Gas bubbles. You could write it right on your chart."
1060,Teacher,"All right? Now, I want to show you something else."
1065,Teacher,"All right. I'm gonna pass back two igneous rocks. In a way they're almost the same, and in another way they're different."
1076,New student,It's hot.
1077,Teacher,"Well, that's because it was near the projector. All right. I just want you to look at it and then pass it back."
1083,Teacher,"You can touch it, but pass it back, because one of these is a fairly rare rock, and I don't have enough for everybody."
1092,Teacher,Pass it.
1094,New student,(inaudible) pass it.
1095,Teacher,Okay. I'm gonna give one to Antwone.
1102,Teacher,"All right. Now, take a look at this."
1106,Teacher,"Now, I'll tell you up front that you're looking at igneous rock, two different samples. Now, if I- if it's igneous rock, where did it come from?"
1122,New student,Lava.
1123,New student,Lava.
1124,Teacher,"All right. Well, yeah. Don't call it mag- don't call it lava. Let's call it magma."
1129,New student,Magma.
1130,Teacher,Okay?
1133,Teacher,"Now, let me tell you a little story."
1142,Teacher,"Here's a cross-section of some part of the crust of the earth. Now, what do you think these horizontal layers are?"
1155,New student,Bricks.
1156,Teacher,What kind of rock?
1157,Single student,Bricks.
1159,New student,Limestone.
1160,Teacher,What kind of rock?
1161,Single student,Bricks.
1162,Teacher,What kind of rock comes in layers?
1164,New student,Sediments.
1165,Teacher,"Yeah. All right? So these are different types of sedimentary rock, the layers. Oldest is on the bottom."
1172,Teacher,"Now, what does it say- what does it say here, Kyra? If you can see it, everybody can."
1179,New student,Magma source.
1180,New student,Magma source.
1181,Teacher,Okay. So at one time this was molten. What happened to at least some of the magma? Look.
1191,New student,It went up.
1192,Teacher,"Well, what happened? What happened, Corey?"
1194,Single student,It went up.
1195,Teacher,"That's right. And what we say is it intruded into the rock that was already there, so we call this an igneous intrusion."
1207,Teacher,"Sort of intruded into the rock that was already there. Now, let's follow this intrusion. Where did this intrusion wind up?"
1218,Two or more students,On the surface.
1219,Teacher,"Ah. Okay. Now, that could be a kind of volcano that they have in Hawaii- they're called shield volcanoes-"
1227,Teacher,"because the magma is very liquidy and loose, so it spreads out."
1232,Teacher,"Now, why would this magma that came out at the surface cool faster than the magma, let's say, that never made it to the surface?"
1245,New student,(inaudible)
1246,Teacher,"I mean, there's a lot. I'm just using this as an example. Cools slowly. Why? Why is that, Delia?"
1254,New student,"Because maybe the air made it cool faster, that's on the surface."
1257,Teacher,"That's exactly right. As a matter of fact, some magma cools even quicker. There's magma- there are volcanoes under water,"
1265,Teacher,"and the magma comes up and freezes much quicker than it does in the air. But, anyway, how many people have ever made rock candy?"
1276,New student,Me.
1277,Teacher,"All right. The longer you let that string hang in the water, what about the size of the crystal? Did you make it that way?"
1288,New student,"No, never-"
1289,Teacher,"All right. Let me show you something. Magma is a liquid, and in the liquid you have charged atoms."
1299,Teacher,"In the seventh grade, you learned that atoms when they become charged, when they become dissolved,"
1308,Teacher,"when they became liquid form- when the state of matter changes, they become ions."
1313,Teacher,"Now, since this is magma and it's a liquid, the atoms can move around. What do you think's gonna be attracted by a positively charged ion?"
1324,New student,//Heat.
1325,New student,//Elec-
1326,New student,Heat.
1327,Teacher,Huh?
1328,New student,Electricity.
1329,New student,Heat.
1331,Teacher,Why?
1332,New student,(inaudible).
1333,Teacher,"Right. So given enough time, positive atoms- positive ions attract negative ions and negatively charged atoms, and they'll-"
1346,Teacher,"they'll line up due to electrical charges. Given enough time, they arrange themselves very orderly, and you might wind up with something like this."
1364,New student,That's cute.
1366,Teacher,What is it?
1367,Single student,A crystal.
1368,New student,It's a crystal.
1369,Teacher,"It's a cry- That's all a crystal is. It's an orderly arrangement of atoms,"
1371,Teacher,"and the atoms align- aligned themselves when the magma was liquid, when it was in a liquid state."
1379,Teacher,"So the longer the magma stays liquid, what can you say about the size of the crystal?"
1385,New student,It gets bigger.
1386,Teacher,It gets bigger. Okay. But suppose the magma comes out at the surface and cools real quick.
1395,Teacher,What's gonna happen to the charged atoms? Will they have a chance to line up and become-
1402,Two or more students,No.
1403,Teacher,"All right. Now, remember the rocks I passed back."
1409,Teacher,"There was one that had big crystals, and there was one that had small crystals. Who has the rock now?"
1418,Teacher,"All right. Do me a favor, Shevaun. Hold up the one that you see has big crystals."
1428,Teacher,Okay. And how do you know it has big crystals?
1431,New student,Because it's kind of sparkly (inaudible).
1435,Teacher,"Yeah. Here it is. Well, here it is. I put this down on my floor."
1440,New student,Marble.
1441,Teacher,"No, it's not- you can see //the-"
1443,New student,//Granite.
1444,Teacher,That's right. It's granite.
1447,Teacher,"All right? So this- this, that cooled under ground, the crystals had time to line up, the magma took a long time,"
1456,Teacher,"because it cooled very slowly, so you get large crystals."
1466,Teacher,"But where the magma- but where the magma comes out at the surface,"
1472,Teacher,"atoms don't- and magma freezes really quickly, atoms don't have time to line up, you get small crystals."
1482,Teacher,Okay? Now who else has the rock now?
1485,Teacher,"Okay, Antigua, hold up the rock that cooled quickly."
1492,Teacher,Hold it up. How do you know that cooled quickly?
1495,New student,Because it doesn't have a lot of crystals.
1498,Teacher,Can you see the crystals?
1499,Single student,No.
1500,Teacher,Can you see little specks in there?
1504,Single student,Yeah.
1505,Teacher,"Those may be those tiny crystals, all right? Now, one more thing. If you're wondering how I'm naming these rocks, it's all on the chart."
1517,Teacher,"First of all, is the rock that you are holding- is it light colored or dark colored?"
1526,Two or more students,Light colored.
1527,Teacher,"Light colored. Okay. Now, notice on your chart it says color: light. So these rocks over here are all light in color."
1540,Teacher,"Now, according to the chart, what the- what's the color of these igneous rocks?"
1546,New student,Dark.
1547,Teacher,"Yeah. It says ""dark."" So since they're light in color, I know and you should know that it could be granite or rhyolites,"
1559,Teacher,"or even a rock called the pegmatite. Now, look over here where it says grain size."
1569,Teacher,"That's a way of describing the crystal size. You might want to write ""crystals"" here."
1578,Teacher,All right? Which of these- which of these word- which of these correspond to something that has a fine grain or tiny crystals? Look at the measurements.
1589,New student,Less than-
1590,Teacher,"Okay. Less than one millimeter or less than a tenth of a centimeter, light colored. That rock is rhyolites."
1602,Teacher,"But if it has bigger crystals, let's say a tenth or one millimeter to a centimeter big-"
1610,New student,It's granite.
1611,Teacher,That's right. Then it's granite. So it's really very simple.
1618,Teacher,"Now, if the rock took a real long time to cool, if it's one centimeter or 10 millimeters or larger, then it's called pegmatites."
1634,Teacher,Let me see. Here's the pegmatite. Look how big those crystals are. There's one crystal right here. It's feldspar. All right?
1649,Teacher,So this one took a real long time to cool. The crystals are really big. We say it has a very big grain size. Okay. Let's wrap this up.
1664,Teacher,"How do you know by looking at an igneous rock, where the rock cooled?"
1669,Teacher,"Where the magma cooled? What's the general rule, Yolanda?"
1675,New student,Maybe because it has a different type of rock in it.
1679,Teacher,"Look at the rock. How do you know that the magma that formed an igneous rock cooled underground? How do you know, Rudy?"
1688,New student,Probably because of the size of the crystals.
1689,Teacher,"Okay. So as the magma cools underground- Rudy, what did you say?"
1696,Single student,The size of the crystal.
1698,Teacher,"Well, tell us about the size."
1700,Single student,//The size- the size of the-
1701,Teacher,//Big? Little?
1702,Single student,Big.
1703,Teacher,Okay.
1707,Teacher,"And on the other hand, if the magma came out at the surface maybe through a volcano-"
1721,New student,Smaller.
1722,Teacher,"Then what's gonna be the size of the crystal? What, Terrence?"
1728,Single student,Small.
1729,Teacher,Okay.
1736,Teacher,"All right. Now, listen to this question. Here's another igneous rock."
1751,Teacher,"You see any crystals in here, Eric?"
1753,New student,No.
1754,Teacher,Okay. Tiny crystals. What's the name of this rock? Look at your chart. Look at your chart.
1764,Teacher,"Here. I got one that was transported by a stream. What's- very ti- well, it's round."
1772,New student,"Oh, my gosh."
1773,Teacher,It's really heavy.
1775,New student,Yeah.
1777,Teacher,"What's the name of it, Shevaun?"
1779,New student,Basalt.
1780,Teacher,Very good. How did you get basalt?
1783,New student,Since Eric said it was tiny in crystal.
1786,Teacher,Okay.
1787,Single student,"I looked at ""less than one millimeter."""
1789,Teacher,Very good.
1790,Single student,And I looked at the dark side.
1791,Teacher,"Ah. (inaudible) dark. Basalt: small, tiny crystals, dark in color, and- look- here are the minerals that make up the rock."
1807,Teacher,Here are the minerals that make up granite and rhyolite.
1812,Teacher,Why do you think granite and rhyolite are light in color? What does that tell you about the minerals- the color of the minerals that make it up?
1820,New student,It has to be-
1821,Teacher,What?
1822,New student,It has to be a light color.
1823,Teacher,"Yeah. And look: quartz, clear to white; feldspar, pink to white."
1831,Teacher,"So the rock is white- light colored, because the minerals that make up the rock are light."
1838,Teacher,"But on the other hand, different parts of the world have different magmas. It's like soup."
1846,Teacher,"So this soup, or this magma, contained dark ones. Here's a dark green. All right? Here's a little bit of black."
1856,Teacher,"So now you know how to name the igneous rocks. Now, suppose you had an igneous rock that cooled so quickly no crystals had time to form."
1866,Teacher,"What's the name of that rock? I can't pass this around because it happens to be very, very sharp."
1875,New student,Ballistic glass.
1877,Teacher,That's right. It's glass.
1884,Teacher,If you ever wondered how did the cavemen shave- how do you- how do you- how did they shave before they had-
1891,New student,With rocks.
1892,New student,With basaltic-
1893,New student,With rocks.
1894,Teacher,"This. If you hit it the right way, it flakes off, and you get something as sharp as a razor blade, even sharper than a razor blade,"
1904,Teacher,and that's how they shaved.
1908,Teacher,"No, really, //if"
1909,New student,//Was it like that?
1910,New student,//No.
1911,Teacher,"//I mean- that's how they shaved, and another thing is, this is- this is one of the items that Indians used as arrowheads and knives."
1918,New student,Yeah.
1919,Teacher,"All right? Now, here. How did you know that, Shevaun?"
1923,New student,What?
1925,Teacher,Where does it say that?
1927,New student,Right here-
1928,New student,It's at the top.
1929,Teacher,Okay.
1930,New student,It's ballistic glass.
1932,Teacher,No crystals. No crystals tells you something about how fast the magma cooled.
1939,New student,It cooled real fast.
1940,Teacher,"Right. So in this case there's magma that cooled so quickly no ions have time to line up,"
1949,Teacher,and you get obsidian if it contains these minerals or basaltic glass if it contains the darker ones.
1961,Teacher,"All right? Now, I sometimes do this. How did- how did the cavemen-"
1966,Teacher,"or how did the American Indians, people that- or before they invented- discovered metal, how did they flake these?"
1975,Teacher,How do you make a tool out of this?
1977,New student,Scrape it against another rock.
1978,Teacher,No. They didn't do that.
1982,Teacher,They didn't do that. And they made some very fine tools out of this.
1990,Teacher,I think the Egyptians used this as scalpels. They did operations. So did the Indians in South America. They did operations.
1998,Teacher,"They didn't have knives- well, they had knives, but how do you fashion this into a sharp-edged tool? How, Sonia?"
2006,New student,They could take it and they (chopped) it on the ground or something.
2015,Single student,Take a (inaudible) the same thing.
2016,Teacher,All right.
2017,New student,"I see, you have to take a-"
2018,Teacher,"I'm not gonna do it; I'm afraid it's gonna fly off and hit somebody, but if you hit it just the right way-"
2023,Teacher,"they used their hands and another tool to bang it on. If you hit it just the right way, you get these flakes that are real sharp."
2039,New student,Mm-hm.
2044,Teacher,I think one went into my finger. I feel a little splinter.
2047,New student,It's right there.
2053,Teacher,Clean as a whistle. It's as sharp as any razor blade.
2065,Teacher,All right? How many people saw the movie Congo?
2070,New student,Me.
2071,Teacher,"Okay. I didn't see it. My son told me about it. It has to do with diamonds, right?"
2077,Two or more students,Yeah.
2078,Teacher,"All right. Delia, what about the diamonds? Where were they?"
2082,New student,They were in some cave.
2084,Teacher,How big were the diamonds?
2088,Single student,I don't remember.
2089,Teacher,All right. I read an article just two days ago. They didn't use real diamonds.
2095,New student,Glass.
2096,New student,(It was fake?)
2097,Teacher,They didn't use glass.
2098,New student,//Stones.
2099,New student,//Diamonds?
2100,Teacher,They used a mineral that you find in granite. It's the clear one. It's called quartz.
2108,Teacher,"All right? Now, this crystal of quartz, is kind of rare because it's called the twin. It has a point on both sides."
2126,Teacher,"Not like this one that has- it's only pointed on one side. Now, as far as I know, there's only one place that has these quartz."
2136,Teacher,"It's called Her- it's found in the city of Herkimer, New York, and they call it a Herkimer diamond."
2144,Teacher,"It's not really a diamond, but it has this shape like a diamond, and that's what they used as diamonds in the movie Congo."
2154,Teacher,"All right? Now, I told you- we talked about Cooperstown- Cooperstown, New York."
2163,Teacher,Remember Cooperstown? Remember Howe Caverns?
2168,New student,Yeah.
2169,Teacher,"Right, Howe Caverns?"
2170,Teacher,"Well, if you go into Howe Caverns to see the limestone cave-"
2182,Teacher,All right? Right here. I think it's a little north of Albany.
2189,Teacher,If you go a little further north- remember the Baseball Hall of Fame is here- you have the town of Herkimer
2198,Teacher,"and as soon as you get into the town of Herkimer you see signs, ""Visit the Herkimer Diamond Mines,"" and that's where it is."
2205,Teacher,"You go to the Herkimer Diamond Mines. They rent you- Antwone, you looking for it?"
2211,New student,Yeah.
2212,Teacher,"You see it? You can rent hammers, goggles, and they'll send you out into this cliff, and you can hack away at the rock,"
2225,Teacher,and that's how I found the- this Herkimer diamond. They're there for you- they're there for you to get.
2232,New student,(inaudible)
2233,Teacher,"Yeah. So it's- it's kind of a neat geology- neat geology trip to go to Howe Caverns, go a little further north, and find- mine Herkimer diamonds."
2247,Teacher,"They're very- I don't think they're found anywhere around the earth except in Herkimer, New York."
2255,Teacher,"All right, now let me ask you- here's a tough question."
2272,Teacher,Okay. How many people saw ET? Does that look familiar?
2278,Two or more students,No.
2279,Teacher,That look //familiar?
2280,New student,//Yes.
2281,New student,No.
2282,Teacher,"This is in Yosemite National Park. It's called Devil's Tower. I believe it's in Yosemite. It's out west. Now, this is solid granite."
2295,Teacher,How could you explain- since granite cools underground slowly- that's why it has big crystals-
2302,Teacher,how in the world can this piece of granite be above the surface?
2317,Teacher,"What do you think, Paola?"
2322,New student,"Oh, um-"
2324,Teacher,"All right. This has large crystals. It cooled slowly, it cooled underground, but yet here it is."
2338,Teacher,"What do you say, Eric?"
2340,New student,I don't know.
2341,Teacher,"What do you say, Carl?"
2342,New student,Huh?
2344,Teacher,"What do you say, Corey?"
2348,New student,I don't know.
2349,Teacher,Kyra?
2350,New student,There is probably more (than one layer of it).
2351,Teacher,No. Samuel?
2353,New student,"Maybe- since it's underground, maybe it was pushing up on the surface, and the surface just probably cracked, and it just came up."
2361,Teacher,Oh. You mean- what are you saying? It really did cool underground?
2365,New student,Yeah.
2366,Teacher,"All right. So if it cooled underground, that would account for the large crystals."
2376,Teacher,"But you see it now above ground- so what do you say, Yolanda?"
2382,New student,"Maybe it cracked the ground, and it came- and it just kept rising."
2387,Teacher,So you mean something pushed it up?
2390,Two or more students,Yeah.
2391,Teacher,Okay. That's very good.
2396,Teacher,Almost.
2399,Teacher,"It was pushed up, but at one time it was an intrusion, and there was rock around it."
2412,New student,And it broke off.
2414,Teacher,What happened to the rock around it?
2417,Teacher,Or what could have happened to the rock around it? And think back to Niagara Falls.
2425,Teacher,Carl?
2426,New student,Because (inaudible).
2429,New student,"Water went over it, and it pushed up."
2432,Teacher,"It might have been water, what?"
2434,New student,The thing that rubbed against it.
2436,Teacher,What wore away?
2437,Two or more students,The rock.
2438,New student,The rock.
2439,Teacher,The s- why?
2440,New student,Because they were soft.
2441,Teacher,Very good. It must have been softer. Okay.
2445,New student,That was a good lesson.
2446,Teacher,Thank you. Yeah. All right.
