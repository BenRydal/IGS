Classroom discussion example data is used with special permission from Mathematics Teaching and Learning to Teach (MTLT), University of Michigan. (2010). Sean Numbers-Ofala. Classroom science lesson data is made possible by the researchers and teachers who created The Third International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) 1999 Video Study. Rogers Hall and David Owens have been key contributors to ideas important to this work. Christine Hsieh and Edwin Zhao contributed early discussions and ideas for a video player interface.
