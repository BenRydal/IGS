# Interaction Geography Slicer (IGS)

Hi there! This is a repository for the Interaction Geography Slicer (IGS), an open-source space-time cube system to dynamically visualize movement, conversation, and audio/video data over space and time.

IGS Features:

- **Browser-based:** Everything in your browser.
- **Visualizations:** Create dynamic 2D/3D space-time visualizations at different scales.
- **Mix multi-modal data sources:** Explore movement, conversation and video data independently or simultaneously in the same visualization.
- **Use in qualitative and quantitative projects:** Supports projects spanning micro-ethnographic analysis of phenomena such as gesture; reflective professional practice in classrooms; and larger scale analysis of urban mobility.
- **Future features:** We are rapidly developing and expanding IGS features and collaborators in this effort are welcome.
